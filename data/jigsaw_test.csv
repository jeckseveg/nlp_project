This was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.

df0e68ecd04e1db4,"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination
Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. 

Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Reliability of U2gigs.com

The second is at the very bottom of the page in a 2007 issue of Billboard in a brief article about the songs played on the Vertigo Tour (link).  It's cited as u2-vertigo-tour.com (which, as your probably know, is the old url of U2gigs.com and typing it in will redirect you to the new site).  I actually just referenced this article from Billboard for the """"Streets"""" article, but it seems pretty redundant since I might have well have cited the website directly.

By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15",0,0,0,0,0,0

I see that you have recently reverted some edits to the naturopathy page. I note that you have given as your reason that the changes to the lead were POV, but that you have not bothered to explain why you think this is so in the discussion page.

Could you please explain why you think it is POV for the article to describe naturopathy as an approach to medicine rather than a single proffesion or standard of care? Do you dispute the fact, or the way in which it was written? I am open to rewriting/compromising to get consensus on an NPOV, but if you are not willing to explain yourself, this will be very difficult. Do you really think that the umberella term 'naturopathic medicine' is represenatative of single entity, group or way of practicing medicine? Could you back this up?
 Could you also explain why it would be considered POV for the article to mention that the principles of naturopathy are practiced in multiple settings (complementary, alternative, and primary care) by traditional healers, NDs, MDs, DOs DC's etc...? Again, do you dispute this fact or the way it was written? I have provided citations for this, did you even consult them before deleting my work? Can you provide a citation asserting the opposite (that naturopathic medicine is an exlusive term owned and used by a single organisation to the exlusion of other types of practitioners)?
Your assertion that naturopathic medicine is 'CAM, not medicine' could be misconstrued to reveal a deep and irrational bias on your behalf. (What do you imagine the 'M' in 'CAM' stands for?) The fact that the term 'medicine' without a modifier is usually interpretted to mean conventional/regular/normal medicine does not mean that the less common practices are somehow not medicine.

I hope that you will take the time to participate in the discussion of the above on the talk page. I will continue to edit what I see as helpful NPOV information about the complex breadth and scope of naturopathy untill you can explain what it is that you do not like about the contributions I have made. On the one hand I can't work in a vaccuum, but on the other hand I won't be bullied into submission either.

I think you're confused in regards to the definition of state. I see that you live in California, United States, which furthers my assumptions. There is more to the word """"state"""" than the """"US state"""" (e.g. Texas, Missouri, etc) definition; a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada, or Serbia, or Cambodia. With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are """"states"""". The terms """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary. The English words """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" are all translated as """"國"""" in Chinese, as Chinese does not make such a distinction. The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China is called """"中華民國國防部"""" (國 = nation), the United Nations is called """"聯合國"""" (國 = nation), the United States Department of State is called """"美國國務院"""" (國 = state), the Commonwealth of Independent States is called """"獨立國家聯合體"""" (國 = state),  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is called """"石油輸出國組織"""" (國 = country).

 EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you.

I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.

I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:

(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. """") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """""""") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """""""")

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

Here's the regex
(date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$

I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.

 that section right there. The """"As a result of such dramatic situation ..."""" you make it sound like it was because of Israel the mutual defence agreement was signed.

 Pseudonymous editing 

copied from an email received offline
Hi,

I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, """"you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""""

Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.

And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.

Thanks,
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz
bathory@bathory.org
bathory@maltedmedia.com

Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  

That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.

By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.

Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.

Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.

Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  

Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.

To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.

I'm not the """"paid editor"""" to which you referred, but I am gravely concerned by the proposal for a change to the terms of use that describes edits as """"deception"""" and allows anyone to make such accusations against any editor at any time. It is impossible for editors to prove they are *not* receiving some form of benefit. The examples of """"benefit"""" (which the WMF has tried to obfuscate now that some people have noticed the expansiveness of the proposal) includes things like receiving a t-shirt or a meal (any """"money, goods or services""""). Unfortunately, there's a great deal of handwaving about paid editing, but very little evidence that there's any greater bias in edits that are paid for than edits that are not.  A large number of the articles created in the latest paid editing """"scandal"""" are still present, and many that were deleted still easily met our notability standards. There is not a good faith editor who hasn't received some sort of benefit or reward from their work on Wikipedia. Nobody has yet demonstrated that people who are paid do any worse at editing Wikipedia than people who aren't paid.  Meanwhile, there's lots of evidence that people who want to push a point of view will not hesitate to accuse editors of being paid or otherwise having a serious conflict of interest (q.v., the Arbcom archives). The proposal is one more tool in the arsenal for people who are motivated to go after their opponents, and does absolutely nothing at all to improve the project.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Call for criminal investigation by Senator Barbara Boxer: section added, deleted, reverted back 

I have added sourced material in a new section regarding an extremely serious matter:  a call by Senator Barbara Boxer of California for the Department of Justice to criminally investigate Southern California Edison's installment of faulty steam generators that have closed the SONGS facility since January of 2012. The section and some of the content has been deleted, and I have reverted the deletion.

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement a",0,0,0,0,0,0

As someone who has performed cost accounting analysis for multinational manufactures of these products; as well as auditing these costs as an external auditor, I can assure that these kosher certification costs are, when “spread” over all products produced, (i.e., products sold, ending inventory, and “spoilage”), are so small that they do not enter corporate financial statements. In accounting and auditing terms, these kosher certification costs are not “material.”

Unless, you are a financial analyst, cost accountant, auditor, or CFO, these kosher certification costs should be of no concern to the consumer.

“Meals and entertainment” costs, corporate aircraft costs, and other extravagant costs commonly incurred by these companies that I have done accounting work for are objectively obnoxious and “material” in that they show up as a line item on financial statements; whereas kosher certification costs are so immaterial that they are lumped together with other marketing costs.

 Some minor revisions to the 1st paragraph of the """"Definition"""" section. 

An obviously jumbled word somehow crept into the beginning of the 2nd sentence of the paragraph:  """"The formula useoefficients of price elasticity....""""  I put in a proposed revision.  

I also changed """"quantity"""" to """"quantity demanded"""" for the sake of clarity and completeness. It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's """"customers""""; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)

In addition, I added """"services"""" to the definition as a token reminder that PED, as well as the laws of supply and demand, apply to both goods and services.

The only other noteworthy revision was to the beginning of the last sentence in the first paragraph to place more emphasis on the PED for the most typical types of goods and services.  Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a """"Law""""!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the """"take-away""""), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  

Again, elasticity is one of the most difficult topics at the introductory level of microeconomics.  It doesn't serve this section or the article well to risk distracting students and other readers from the main point too early with such minor exceptions, however interesting they may be to the intellectually curious readers. Once we've made the main point as clear as possible, then devoting some time to the exceptions is much less likely to cause confusion or ambiguity.
  
I have one more suggested revision along this line for the paragraph, and I'll return to it as soon as time permits.

I made a few other copyedits were purely minor, e.g., deleting an occasional unnecessary word to polish the prose just a bit.

Noticed that this IP has been banned due to vandalism, and if I could, would highly recommend that you contact Internode about this.

It may be quite possible that he could initiate some action against the *actual* vandal if you are able to provide a clean time and date that the offending IP did it's work.  I *think* actions like this would be against the agreement made with Internode on fair use.

In any case, he's a great guy who just won't ignore the issue.

 First a suggestion for Sarah Welsh, if you are """"struggling"""", and that too with the very first words of the article , just hold off rather than going ahead and still editing the article (and making it, as you did in this case, almost impossible for anyone to comprehend). This is not someone's personal blog, but a page with more than 2000 daily views. So please act with discretion.

 Second, your allegation that my edits """"distorted and misrepresented the sources such as Nesbitt's OUP book"""" is a complete LIE. I did not even bring in the Nesbitt book. So, again, as has been found out on many prior occasions, don't mislead people and please show some civility. Rather, it is you who removed reliably sourced content that did not comply with your own biased views, while you were on your massive blind spree to undo all my edits. For instance, I had quoted directly from Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, that I had referenced when mentioning word of God """"The Granth presides over all congregations and represents the word of God in permanent form"""", which you blindly removed.

 Coming now to the sentence in the first paragraph on the key beliefs, I had made an edit a few days ago. You again made modifications to them. I suggest you actually go and read the sources well. In any case, I have added another source, and all the beliefs I have included are now present in the three cited sources. Now of course, to make complete sentences and for improved readability, I have to add some of my own words. (e.g., key beliefs are """"engaging in"""" selfless service, """"striving for"""" social justice; rather than selfless service, social justice.)

Secondly, there's several parts of the article that seem to violate, or at least come close to it, POVweaselle word rules, etc.
Things like """"described by acquaintances"""" (w/o citations) sounds more like someone who knew him is trying to defend his image or something. There are a number of similar phrases throughout the article. Also the whole thing makes the guy sound like a perfect human with no real faults.

 WIKIPEDIA IS ! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.

 Controversy - a litltle balance, maybe? 

I'm fully aware that most of the authors of this articles are pro-Kerry or at least anti-Bush, but should it be quite so obvious to the reader?  

Actually, the main part of the article (while not always completely balanced)has a fair amount of give-and-take, attempting to lay out each side's statements and the other's responses.  It's clear that we have some very different opinions, but we're making some good headway here.

BUT the """"Controversy"""" section is almost entirely attacks from one side(about two dozen sentences), the long list of allegedly significant """"ties"""", and numerous (often angry) quotes from Kerry's team and supporters (including many in the media), many of which add little or no actual information or argument for their position.  On the other side we find a few brief Bush-Cheney denials, and maybe two quotes.  Fine, if you're trying to sound like an LA Times editorial.  But I didn't think that's what we were after here.

(And, of course, there is the insistence that certain responses to charges are not relevant, even if these are the actual responses Bush, et.al. are making.   I didn't think it was our job to judge the strength of each side's argument simply to seek to represent it fairly.)

Could we afford to shorten and limit the number of quotes that add more heat than light?   And is it possible to resist the temptation to insist that every statement that might appear more favorable to Bush or Cheney (there are precious few as it is!) must immediately be countered?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not.

5ba16f842c9cd64b,"Explanation of undo 

Just to elaborate a little more on my undo in this edit.

It is true that at some level you can always replace a function by a relation giving the same information.  For a unary function symbol f, you can substitute a relation symbol R, and interpret it via R(x,y) if and only if f(x)=y.

However, there are significant differences between languages that contain function symbols and ones that have only relation symbols.  Function symbols have existential import, in the sense that if you have a structure for a language with a function symbol f, and a closed term t in the language, then the structure must contain an interpretation for f(t).  Relation symbols don't give you that; a structure for a language containing our relation symbol R above is not guaranteed to have an object y such that the structure satisfies R(t,y).

This is important for lots of tools used to analyze structures.  For example, the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game is usually defined for languages that have only relation and constant symbols.  If you allow non-nullary function symbols, the analysis gets more complicated.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The hardest-working, most experienced, most involved critic of this article has misgivings about mediation. Let's start now.
Is the CMT fringe?
If a consensus is reached to the effect this is a fringe theory, the article will need to make that clear in a way that is neutral. Once. Not over and over again in every nook and cranny. Sly, underhanded discredits like the top link in """"See also"""" being to Bible conspiracy theory make you (whoever put it there) appear to be sleazy and contemptible. It gives the impression that you play dirty, that the quality of your argument against the theory is so weak you need to apply Fox News persuasion techniques. I'm sure none of that is the case. But that's the impression it gives. 

And the word fringe need not be used. The word in general parlance carries a derogatory implication (marginalized and nutty), whereas the way we use it, fringe theory is """"not mainstream"""". Something like """"the theory is not widely accepted by mainstream theologians and historians"""" conveys it's place in the field without stooping to derision.

Personally, judging only on the quotes provided by Eugene in the FAQ, which are opponents speaking, but includes one proponent (I think - did I delete him?) who concedes the view is considered eccentric, and in the absence of any counter evidence, I have no choice but to conclude it is a fringe theory.

I have posted many images of Hindu / Arya /Indian wrestlers but just got time to read this rediculious discussion about this very article and i want to show , point out the realites about the wrestling and ground leval facts. But important i don't want to insult any one , specially the creator of this article but just want to show the truth.
1) The objection that the art of wrestling never existed in india and it is imported from Iran and other outside countries is pure colonial tact. As you can find out that any good thing which comes from India is not real Indian / Aryan / Hindu but is imported from outside to India and we Indians are basterd offsprings from that .No new to we!! The great Alfanso Mangos are not local from Konkan region but are brought to India by the Portugies and such other numerious theories put in this new world firstly by the British and later by Amiricanus. Brother Iranians i have read little history of Iran. As we all know that originaly all Iranians befoure the birth of Islam were not muslims but Aryan as the word Iran itself stands for littrley as the dewwlling of Aryans outside mainland India. And what happned when the Arabs now converted to Islam attacted to Iran ?? Were the gret Iranians who now boast that they are the creator and founder of this wrestling art able to protect the own country and ther religion ?? No!! No!!. And to escape from this attct wher the Iranians flead ?? Even to China !! O.K NOW TELL ME WE Aryans/ Marathas / Hindus / Indians fought 1000 years to Islamic invision and reuled and 200 years of British rule and now where are we and where are those grate Mughals/ Brtish / Afghans/ Pakistanis/ Turks / ETC . Thre truth is that we Aryans / Marathas / Hindus / Indians not only surveyed but overcome this invision and eat those invaders and will eat in feauter. We were succesful not only to get freedom but also keep alive our Arya/ Hindu religion along with our gods , traditions , educations such as Ayurveda , Yoga . Dance , Music and all other properties.
I dont want to get involved in to more discussion because i am alone and in my surrounding neberhood yor fans and brothers are present. I am awere of this fact as anyone can gess from the present condition of India.

2) The objection that the WWF wrestling in the world is facke , circus and not worthy to call as real wrestling and those who perform it as wrestler. Yess. I do agree. I have seen those WWF entertienment on cable TV sINCE 1992 and from the begining i was desliking to this Americanus beggares play. But in reality in my surrounding i have observerd great wrestlers and seen how much respect our Maratha society gives to these wrestlers.The traditional Maratha wrestling and wrestler has many sides and aspects , i will discuss it later but any way one can understand it if he is clever.Allthough these Indian wrestler are not successful in international competations such as Olympics , But if you see the ecomomic and weather conditions of India you may find the answer.In our Maratha society wrestiling is a good social title and way of life such as Docters and other professionals.   I use to workout and do exircise when i was in school and college and aimes to earn great body. I never exirsised in traditional Indian mud wrestling gym but in western kind of modern gym and before that some traditional exirsises and other like cricket , boxind etc.
I am owner of good body and realy have loved and perpormed workouts so i belive that i have right to say somthing about wrestling.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase.

In cases where too many characters are being included on the main page, it is proper to make a seperate page for characters and leave only the main characters on the main page.  That would be the Ushiromiya family, the servants, and Beatrice.  Also, just because you can include spoilers, does not mean you should go overboard.

 The """"National Champions"""" banners on the season records tables for 1919, 1927 and 1939 on pages 157, 158 and 159 of the 2012 media guide, with no further explanation, are ambiguous in light of the unequivocal statement """"National Championship Teams . . . 1 . . . 1939"""" on page 150.  If, in fact, the A&M; athletic department is now officially claiming the 1919 and 1927 championships, they are contradicting themselves in the very same publication.

Placenames in Kosovo

Please, before making or discussing changes to the names used in all Kosovo-related topics, review carefully our general naming conventions and the specific ones on geographic names, using English & settlements.

In short, they ask us to reflect common English usage (which will often will be a local name, or one of them; but not always), because those are the forms our intended readership of English speakers would most easily recognize.

For a number of historical reasons, the English language has adopted the Serbian forms. We merely restrict ourselves to reflect this usage. Wikipedia is not a venue to advocate the adoption of the Albanian names by the English language.

The trouble is that that version was hype too. Wikipedia is not a press coverage scrapbook (WP:LINKFARM) - I realise it was put in to peacock Ethereum for the AFD (which is why it looked so artificial), but the point stands that if those articles are worth including, they need to actually be used as references.
I note also the heading is """"reception"""" - none of it is talking about how Ethereum has been received, it's just a list of press clippings. From e.g. the version before I touched it, there's two statements from non-SP-notable people and one from someone notable enough to have a WP article who also happens to do amateur economics blogging.

 Nothing personal 

Greetings Elitra, I just wanted to let you know my comments are nothing personal towards you or the other WMF folks but the release of VE with so many problems is premature and folks have a valid point that proper notification wasn't given. Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  

 Your user page 

Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone 

 Random act of kindness 

 Hello Elitre (WMF), Eduemoni has given you a shining smiling star! You see, these things promote WikiLove and hopefully this has made your day better. Spread the  whether it be someone you have had disagreements with in the past or someone putting up with some stick at this time. Enjoy! ↑talk↓

 False statements 

This is a false statement:

""""Russia is offering full cooperation to Polish prosecutors during the investigation.[52] Polish investigators in Russia have been given access to all procedures of Russian investigators. They do not have the authority to conduct investigative actions by themselves, but they are participating on equal terms with their Russian counterparts in the interviews with people involved and other parts of the investigation. Polish officials are to secure all Polish state documents found in the wreckage, as well as electronic devices (portable computers and mobile telephones) belonging to government officials and military officers. In turn Russian investigators received from Poland materials secured after the crash, including those about the technical state of the airplane and fitness of the pilot. """"

""""which at around 06:30 local time on 22 May 2010,"""" - You should note which time zone it is referring to when it says """"local time"""", or better yet, just put the time in UTC. 
Some references are in the wrong places, because it looks like some statements are unsourced. This is the situation in the following statements:
""""Initial reports from survivors suggested a tyre burst[6] as the aircraft attempted a go-around."""" - Move reference #6 to the end of the sentence.
""""800 feet (240 m),[54] well before the aircraft made a touch down."""" - Move reference #54 to the end of the sentence. 
""""and also of the alleged hostile attitude of the airline's counsel.[80] Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) along with Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airline's office in Mangalore where they submitted a memorandum to officials demanding that families of the victims receive early and equitable settlements of compensation due. They also demanded the settlement process be made more transparent by opening it to the media rather than holding sessions in camera."""" - Either the reference (#80) is in the wrong place, or this statement really is unsourced.
The units of measure are inconsistent as to whether it is American first or metric first (e.g. 2,000 feet (610 m) and 90 metres (300 ft); they should be American first and metric last or vice versa, but not both).

I came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.
There has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.
I found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.
I look forward to hearing from interested parties.
 Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:
 Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)
 Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it's probably ok now, too.
 Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.
 Drawing most of the information from Solzh's Gulag and dissidents' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page's discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is """"evil"""", as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. 
 Furthermore, Solzh's book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70's and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.
Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.  
I appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing.

Experienced editors know that already, and whether it's really helping any newbie and preventing enough non-constructive edits to be worth it is very doubtful, IMHO.

Excerpt from the book by Grateful Dead Bass Player Phil Lesh:

The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.

For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit. The process by which they become one is called bleshing, from a combination of mesh and blend. (Today’s archetype would be the X-Men.)

Now I'm going to put the page back the way it was.  And I'll add this reference to it.

great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called """"post-industrial"""" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).

Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as """"noise music"""".

Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now. I find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is more likely to protect the project in the long run to let you learn that such behaviour will lead to a block which will stick, as that may perhaps encourage you to stop and think before the situation reaches the point of a block.

 Use of """"America"""" when the meaning is """"United States"""" 

You are correct, that one irks me so whenever I see it I change it )

In school, the difference between America and the United States was beaten into our heads. America is two continents. The United States is one country. There is no country or nation named """"America"""". So when someone puts """"Nationality - American"""" , well, what does that tell us ? He's not European or Russian, I guess. But he she or it could be from Guatemala, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Peru or thirty other countries. The use of """"American"""" in that way is flat-out wrong. And becoming more and more common, alas !

You are correct, occasionally using 'United States' becomes very cumbersome in a sentence. As an occasionality, what the heck. But we really need to stomp on this total misuse of the name """"America"""" when people really mean """"United States.""""

 This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).

 The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.

 The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.

 In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

In fact, the army has already accepted the Arjun for introduction into service, based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. After firing trials in summer 2006, the trial report (written by the army) said: """"The accuracy and consistency of the Arjun has been proved beyond doubt.""""

The ongoing trials in Pokhran that the army is citing are Accelerated Usage cum Reliability Trials (AUCRT). In these, two Arjun tanks were run almost non-stop for 3,000 kilometres, not to judge performance, but to evaluate the tank's requirement of spare parts, fuel and lubricants during its entire service life.""""

She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and administrators have a conflict of interest to various articles.   So since you  “Lessheard vanU” have personally chosen to block IP addresses and made false allegations against me and other contributing people, we are requesting clarification.   When did Blackpearl14 become owner, controller and self judge of certain wikipedia articles?  If you believe that Blackpearl14 owns and has absolute control over Pirates of the Caribbean articles, then please state that is the policy.  Why is Blackpearl14 allowed to violate wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose?  Why are other editors and administrators upholding double standards?  For you can’t have double standards, as the wikipedia written policies detail a cooperative community effort for articles and, it’s suppose to be neutral. 

Furthermore, there is no way to discuss nor talk about the reckless actions of Blackpearl14 without saying and describing what they are.  Yet, immediately, Blackpearl14 has wrongly and irresponsibly calls anyone placing anything critical or changes to certain pages she had appointed herself as self controller of, as “vandals” and outright claims that she is being “attacked”, and then goes to her peers with which to delete the talk and discussion,  leaving only the editors and administrators’ comments and self bias online, while blocking IP’s.   What is shocking that you don’t know who I nor other contributing writers are.    Why are Blackpearl14 actions being upheld?

 criticism of quran

well, on the criticism of the quran, i have made a message on the talk page.
""""people"""" have gotten into the article and mixing criticism of islam with criticism of quran.
2-3+ parts of the article are clear criticisms of islam(i.e. strange customs associated with """"muslim"""" cultures).

these kinds of tricks these """"people"""" use on their enemies need to be stamped out, and since you are a big time contributor to islamic entries, i'd like your help. this whole article should be removed anyway, or an equally long and bias article of criticism of other religions and cultures, especially by those who edit this article should be made.

Got ur message/question.  I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....

It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  

In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.

Anyhow i think you handled it right.  Thanks for checking in!",0,0,0,0,0,0
92ea10142a68b2ec,"""*:well... now that I look at the article more closely I can at least see where this movereq is coming from, and it's not as tendentious as I thought. This article is a mess... I still don't support renaming it though, as the """"provide a worldwide view"""" within this article is a mistake. As I mentioned above there are plenty of articles that can and should provide a worldwide view of Gun control issues, but the subject of this article is a US centric subject and should be re-factored in order to be presented as such. Rather then worrying about the name just get to work copy editing the article.
You seem to be arguing that there should be an article split, one article for the global and a split out article for the USA centric views.  Right?  If so, the problem still remains that the title of the global half of the split should have a global viewpoint.  And, the """"keep and"""" portion of the article title (taken from the US Bill of Rights) is decidedly USA centric.  Explain how """"keep and"""" is global.    
Or perhaps the article could take an approach as describing purely the concept of RKBA, and maybe the cultures and/nations where it exists, and other subjects as necessary (although I suspect the same debates will come up in those areas).  Perhaps altering the general approach and method of the article could be an alternative to renaming/moving it.  I'd be willing to give it a shot if everyone else would.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

What I propose is that the section be condensed so that only the major highways are dicussed in detail and have some helpful pictures while the minor highways (let's say, length < 25km) are listed on the chart but we don't go into too much detail. This way, we can link to all the expressways in the country but only list the important ones in the article. My proposed layout for the article would look like:

 Existing expressways

 Mumbai-Pune Expressway

 National Expressway 1 
discuss further
 Sion Panvel Expressway 
discuss, another picture would be nice too
 Delhi Gurgaon Expressway

 Planned Expressways

 Jesus article too long 

Recently, I was trying to add quotes of Jesus to the article but I got a revert with this response:  """"this article is long enough - refer reader to wikisource or other articles"""" Doc glasgow

The problem with this is that many if not all wiki articles on people have quotes of them, and many of them have """"quotes"""" sections.

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a """"Other topics about Jesus"""" towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.

I propose that we condense these topics:

1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section)
2. Background
3. Names and titles
4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics
5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals

And then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.

Also, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.

This should substantially reduce these sections:
1. Notes
2. Sources and further reading
3. See also
4. External links

After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.  Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice, and maybe Jesus can become a featured article.

One final point that may not be apparent to contemporary readers.  We have a hard time understanding today why anyone would think a spherical earth implies habitation on the far side...after all, the entire backside could be endless ocean, right?  Or barren desert?  But to the early Medievalist, the earth was created by God, for the purpose of providing home to mankind.  It seemed incomprehensible to such men that God would create an entire """"second world"""", below and unreachable from the first...and leave it wholly empty.  In their anthropocentric viewpoint, this was outrageous.  And this is much of the justification for the tacit linkage between """"rotundity"""" and """"inhabited antipodes"""" in many early MA sources.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Macedonia: History – Encyclopaedia Britannica

Macedonia owes its name to the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (or Macedon). Centred in the southern part of the region, (i.e. present-day Northern Greece) this kingdom seems to have been largely Greek-speaking, with Thracian and Illyrian admixtures. By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized. Macedonia’s Greek ethnic composition was overturned by the invasion of Slavic peoples into the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.

Paionia (historical region) – Encyclopaedia Britannica

Paeonia,  the land of the Paeonians, originally including the whole Axius (Vardar) River valley and the surrounding areas, in what is now northern Greece, (Republic of) Macedonia, and western Bulgaria. The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Under the Romans, Paeonia was included in the second and third districts of the province of Macedonia. By ad 400, however, the Paeonians had lost their identity, and Paeonia was merely a geographic term

Like on many pages, a consensus will never form, unless people who have a fairly objective take on affairs decide to leave the page to the POV pushers. This page, like many pages of strong national interest to certain users, will forever be a battleground. I'm sure you've seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only, and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest. They post a certain perspective on the topic, and basically exert ownership over the topic. People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias, and try to change the page, are quickly overwhelmed. Even when they are not, and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle, sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus.  This is exactly what happened here.

 re: VfD bot assistant 
When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of """"simple"""" decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.  

Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for """"keep"""" decisions vs """"delete"""" decisions?

The essential steps for a """"keep"""" decision are:
 Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})
# Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together
# Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.

If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple """"keep"""" decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  """"Keep as merge"""", """"transwiki"""", etc. would still require extra steps.

The essential steps for a """"delete"""" decision are:
# Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order
# Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)
# Sometimes, check """"what links here"""" and move or delete all those links
# Delete the page

I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.  Thanks again.  ~~~~""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, while I understand your concerns over the article, there are bits of policy that have become standard, and while I mean no offense, it is in fact discouraged that PR firms edit the articles of people or organizations they represent (see WP:AUTO) due to concerns that a potential conflict of interest in one's editing could result in a non-neutral point of view, which is often remedied by the edits of uninvolved, neutral editors without an opinion over a piece.

 Troubling aspects of the artiicle as it exists right now 

1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.

2) This is new. It's from Conason: """"Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments."""" Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.

3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: """" She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as """"harmless American citizens"""" [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.""""
Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. 

This quote is also troubling: """"Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing."""" Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:
""""Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.""""

Whady'a say?

(Much more on this section later.)

4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.

5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are """"not as bright"""" as men'?
Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

Pressure

A source is being mis-used where there is a statement that says the fringe media pressured these various agencies to respond.   

Entry says:Because of the popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many enquiries from people demanding an explanation.[1][3]

I think it is dubious and the source does not mention popularity as the cause for this pressure nor do these vague inquires seem to be specific incident complaints of the type these agencies investigate. This would require times, dates, locations, to proof of an incident much less any """"suspect"""" worthy of investigation by the responding agencies.  One caveat is that these are alleged to be CBW issues and an environmental agency, space agency, or weather agency, or FAA would not even be the primary agency to respond, In my opinion, they might be notified or have something forwarded to them if only to answer questions that they might receive.  After enough questions they made fact sheets.  Were the fact sheets released solely because the theory is popular or because of the exasperating questions?  It should worded better. example below:.  Not sure what the dead link said. It's not verifiable.
 
Source states:

This is example consistent with the remaining source:
Government agencies have received persistent questions from people who have asked for an explanation.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Jorge Gracie 
The article was deleted via a 3-2 vote.  This isn't a consensus but rather a small majority. I have seen quite often when a 3-2 vote did not result in deletion but the talk of no consensus reached.   Additionally, many individuals in the articles for deletion noted Jorge via MMAnote rather than MAnote .   At worst, I would like to have this article userfied.  Thank you.    
Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! 
Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   
I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! 
Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the """"Significant coverage"""" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that. I mention WP:BASIC specifically because this is (was) a biography and BASIC pertain to biographies specifically. Most critically is the section: """"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   
I have reviewed the sources. Have you read the guideline on reliable sourcing The only reliable source in the deleted article was the book reference and that was roughly 100 words. That and fan sites does not a wikipedia biography make. Also see Other stuff exists.  Humbug! 
You can userfy it over here.  I will update it and improve it. Buddy23Lee you can perform fixes to it as well.  Make it a complete article. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:CrazyAces489/jorgegracie

If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some """"real Arab"""" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of """"al-Qushayri"""" roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the """"forced"""" out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they """"lived happily ever after!"""", and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and """"Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge""""!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their """"educated"""" people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   22:15, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Stop adding so much unnecessary edits to the C train article. I don't know why you're going into more detail about the R32s. It's just a damn train. Nobody cares how often a train breaks down or whatever issues it has. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a Mean Distance Between Failures figure about how often any train break downs or whatever. Besides, the C train and the R32 car articles already mentions the breakdown rates anyway, just in a more subtle way. All it matters is just simply saying that the R32s were moved to outdoor lines to save their aging air compressors from having to work underground all the time. That's it. There's no need to mention what kind of issues the cars themselves have nor how they are/were solved. At least, in my book, your edits to the C train article were either completely over-opinionated, unsourced, or both, and thus, are not needed to mention. It's not like you work for the MTA anyway, so don't speculate about railcar maintenance, inspection or issues.

Therefore it is not appropriate to make the """"small minority of scientists"""" claim.  The only accurate way to assess the opinions of a large group of scientists is to poll them, as every researcher does not necessarily believe every word in a study they participate in.

 Maybe the larger question is this: what do scientist's opinions matter? They don't get paid to have opinions, but to do objective research.  Let's talk about the results.

 Re:Dennis Brown's final warning 

I didn't mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. I didn't violate the final warning; CurtisNaito did (multiple times). The exact wording of the warning was """"If either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility, bludgeons a discussion, violates WP:IDHT, acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors, then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of 72 hours."""" At no point did I push the boundaries of civility, bludgeon a discussion, violate IDHT, act in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. CurtisNaito displayed the exact same kind of IDHT behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions, and when told explicitly that he was violating Dennis Brown's final warning, he kept doing it.

Your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual, when nothing I had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning, was an off-topic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.

Hi there, since you do not wish to have a united article representing all point of views and would like to stick to your point of view, I have no rights to prevent you other than that of a fellow wikipedian from South Asia. I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia. Here is something that I have to say as regards your recent posts in this page:

 About:
Eukesh, you say all the right things, that we need a neutral article, that you want to be constructive, but at the end of it, it seems your mind is closed. You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available? you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan. FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed. you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan? You conclude that it is 'entirely a Bhutanese issue' and nothing could be further from the truth. If nepal wasn't quite the economic basketcase it has become, maybe the rest of us in the region wouldn't have to deal with such an outflow of emigrants from your country. 

About:
 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet."""" 

Please do not comment about Nepalese press in a nation where it has played a major part in bringing a revolution from a nation where there is virtually no press. The press here is not garbage. However, I did not care about the Bhutanese refugee case until I found that it was missing here and thought of writing about it.

About:
 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available?""""

Wikipedia is available in net. Do you call it garbage? I have cited the information from sites of globally accepted bodies and not from the sites hosted by some pro- or anti- groups or some blog pages

About:

FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed.

I do not have a point of view. I agree that I have made some points which were offensive to some, but it was not intentional and were derived from the data. There was a speculation which was corrected later. I just posted what were there in websites of UNHCR and other global organizations which is something that is done in wikipedia. I have told you that people of Nepalese origin are found throughout the world. Many might be stateless. However, the reports of UNHCR shows otherwise in case of Bhutanese refugees. If you can change their view, please do. Otherwise stop editing with whatever you wish to write or in your own words, stop garbaging wikipedia.

 About """"being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed."""" Well, there is nothing which can top this sort of irresponsible comment.

5. The industry is in the billions of dollars cleared and settled which makes is significant
6. There were many industry references leading to the history
7. There was no blatant discussion as to benefits of this payment type over other payment types or in comparison to the competition. Therefore there was no blatant advertising.

  The BLPN thread begins with this from you
After reverting an addition of a name of a living person to this article based on doubtful reasoning and subsequently the name being re-added, I am concerned about the basis of the whole article. There is an assumption that someone who is alleged to have had sex with a """"novice"""" or """"student"""" or """"disciple"""" (without unambiguous definitions of these terms) is fair game to be listed in this article as a """"sex abuse case"""". Some of the names listed have had no legal proceedings taken against them, others have been reported as having reached out of court settlements without the case being proven. There are obvious issues with the name of the article, the selection criteria for names being added and confusion about how well such cases need to be sourced. Fæ (talk) 
 However you spin it, it was you who initiated this process and you did not extend me the courtesy of informing me. I did not revert any deletion of yours in your account name unless it was an IP deletion or from another account and for each reversion I made I noted in the edit summary that I had referred to it  on the talk page and there gave my reasons and asked for dialogue.
 If I had seen your concerns I would have noted first of all that unambiguous definition of terms is not common in discourses and in any case I began the article with a clear description of what was meant by  'abuse' in the context of the article. Even in the drafting of legislation where great care is taken to be unambiguous there is nevertheless a need to leave some terms undefined: for example 'nation' in EU leglislation, 'indecent' in UK criminal legislation (in the context of child protection) - the examples are legion. In any case it is perfectly well understood what abusive sexual behaviour amounts to and abusive behaviour need not be criminal. In particular teacher-student sexual relationships are universally regarded as abusive on the part of the teacher. The selection criteria was mentioned in the article - that the individuals involved had founded Buddhist groups at the forefront of the emerging Western Buddhist movement.

 Using Joan Roth as a source for Bukharan history 

The website of photographer Joan Roth is being used as a source for the assertion that the Bukharans are Jews whose ancestors did not return from the Babylonian captivity.  I humbly submit that while Joan Roth may be an expert photographer, she is not an expert historian.  If someone wants to use her as a history source, email her (I'd do it myself, but I don't have time presently) at JoanLRoth@aol.com, and ask her for her sources for her assertion.  If those sources are found to be sound historically, then they can be used as reliable sources.

He said that SOA Watch can be used, but its a 'weak source' I don't even agree with that. They are the premier researchers on the school/institue. They have filed FOIAs and and discovered the hundreds of human rights abusers who went to the school. They work with news medias and HROs all over Latin America to track these graduates and see when they commit crimes in their home countries and report them. I agree that we cant say 'WHINSEC is bad' only because SOAW says 'they're bad', but look at what happened yesterday. I added info on a legislative action. No one is going to argue that the SOAW made it up that there was a legislative action. It was first linked to SOAW. Someone removed it. It was then linked to a Catholic HRO. Someone removed it.

aad060d873f43d6e,"It is just like synthpop being a precursor to techno. Synthpop is white music whilst Techno is black music. Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too. But who started using 45rpm breakbeat over 4-tofloor is enigma to me personally.

Black music may be considered a 'racial term', therefore i think you'll enjoy more politcorrect one: 'Pop music genre created by black people of African/Carribean (may be also Indian) origin'. I asure, no one here wants it to start any racial war.  82.209.225.33",0,0,0,0,0,0

I assume his reasoning for the undo was because the added info contained Gogs projected involvement in Final crisis (something that seems obvious, but has not been officially announced.  I removed all predictions and made the added info stick to only the facts given in JSA #14.  I did like the addition of the fact that the origin of Gog in pre-infinite crisis does not match this current version.  Now that the addition has been fixed, I hope that anyone who edits this adds two it and does not simply revert it.  If you do revert something, explain your reasoning so we don't get into and editing war.  Thanks   
 
It is important to note that there have been three different origins for Gog. And all three characters made it to the main D.C. continuity.  His Hyperspace spanning, Time traveling, Multiverse jumping nature makes this character inherently hard to grasp when looking at the multiverse or even just the main DC universe. 
     
First, from the Kingdom Come timeline:  He Survived Kansas's destruction. Given powers by the Quintessence, he stole Superman and Wonder Woman's baby, went back through Hypertime killing Superman over and over again.  He was defeated in the Main DC continuity by Kingdom Come and main versions of the heroes.  

The second version of Gog was basically a homage to the first, but without the tricky use of Hypertime and the Kingdom come continuity.  He survived Topeka's (only) destrucion.  He kept going back in time and advancing his work over and over.  This Guy made it into the pages of Superman comics.  

The third version is the one in the current run of JSA.  He claimed he was got his power from Gog, Last God of the Third World.  And he complained about all of kansas being destroyed.  This origin actually resembles the first more than the second.  This makes it likely that he is from Earth-22, like the superman in JSA.  It is common for the new 52 Earths to resemble previous DC comic's Elseworlds, but have some differences.  It has already been shown that Earth-22 resembles Kingdom Come, but has some slight differences.  This explains the Kansas destruction being the same, but the change in his power source being from quintessence to a Third World god. Although time will tell if this is right, it does seem like the logical conclusion.  Someone can add this to the article when it is revealed in the pages of JSA.   

To answer the above question, the Quintessence were fooled.  Phantom stranger thought that this man, who came out of the Kansas massacre, and started a Superman Church, would be a good representative of the values that the quintessence hold. But they were mistaken (gods a fallible in comics).  The guy snapped after getting the powers, went a little nuts, and killed Superman over and over.  The quintessence decided not to take back their power, but I am not sure if they explained why.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello Ben. May I start by noting that you have not attended to a single point I have made, but merely made unfounded protestations without any factual evidence to back them; please write all sources and proof if you have a factual point to make? These reverts to the long-standing article were not my writings, they were edits back to a well-accepted compromise (a fact you surreptitiously ignore), and the main text has been in an approved state for months now. Two separate administrators are happily with its compromise from both sides, but you appear to think you can smash in here like a bull in a china store, and rearrange the whole lot based on your own religious biases and PR campaigns for the Watchtower org. As I kindly pointed out Ben, please read all the talk pages, yes all 14 of them before you do any more vandalizing, and make casual unfounded accusations. These subjects have been debated many times and a common compromise was reached months ago, which you appear clearly not interested in. Your selfishness in trying to destroy the hard work of others and their extensive debates on these matters is quite typical of many with your religious background (the blinkered view that any method is acceptable if it makes the JWs look good in the public eye). Censorship is not welcome here, especially when it has a blatant religious agenda and bias. You have failed to make a single point of valid criticism that has not been discussed at great length before (please go and read all 14 pages of talk) as you might start to understand why you are being so unreasonable and astoundingly narrow-minded. Wikipedia is here for factual information, not public relation promotions for religious sects; if you want that then go to the Watchtower's website. If you have a specific point with referenced proof and backup, then bring it here and discuss it, but please check it has not already been done before, and please don't come out with more nebulous vague accusation with no specific point or proof. If you have facts you feel are incorrect, then produce your documented proof with references, then it can be discussed here in a mature way, before any possible changes are made.

 Responses 

I am not in a position where I will be able to correspond extensively on this matter, but I thought I owed it to everyone to try and put together a few general responses.
Yes, I should not have used the """"are you now or have you ever been?"""" sort of construction, and I've modified it per MONGO's suggestion.  While I've seen Malleus' behavior over time neglect basic civility, it was incorrect for me to assume that it's always been that way.
No, the statement was not a personal attack.  The reactions alleging that I've been attempting to """"unperson"""" Malleus are hyperbolic and simply not true.  Malleus does not conform to the fourth pillar.  One must conform to all five pillars to be a Wikipedian; that is the social conract.  While my earlier thoughts had been running along the lines of one must endorse all the pillars, that puts an emphasis on belief rather than conduct. 
One can be banned after making many valuable contributions to Wikipedia.  The various persons who are banned: Jack Merridew/Bre'r Rabbit/Gold Hat/etc. is not an unperson.  Betacommand is not an unperson.  Will Beback is not an unperson.  I would argue that my statement could be equally applied to any of them or other banned users for a similar reason: each of them failed to uphold the fourth pillar, although in a variety of ways and intensities, and was banned for that.  Malleus has the distinction of being the most prolific content creator being up for a ban in my memory.  The content he has created has is not in question, and he has had an admirable pattern of contribution to the encyclopedia... but that's not sufficient.  Much like Betacommand, Malleus has been shown repeatedly that his style of interaction is insufficient, and he has chosen to continue it. No one has proposed that Malleus' contributions be erased, that his name be stricken from anywhere or anything.  Bans don't do that, and the proposed ban would not have been any different than any other ban.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here's a few reviews from Amazon.com:

A fiercely nationalistic book every American should read, August 5, 2002 

This book was a million-seller in Japan, and was translated into English in 1991. The author was a promininet Japanese politician. The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views. Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern Japan should read it. Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing. 
Author Ishihara avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that Japan is the equal of the United States, that Japan should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and Japan will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations. 

Ishihara berates America for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on Germany because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow. He asserts that nations colonized by Japan have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by the United States. 

The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in Japan, and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood. 

Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten Hiroshima any more than America has forgotten Pearl Harbor. Ishihara's call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken. Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best. 

Very highly recommended, even if slightly dated. 

emblematic parochialism and obscure nationalist rage, September 19, 2006   

I read this book in the CIA-translated version as a Senate aide concerned about the rise of Japan, which included as co-author one of the leaders of Sony (Morita). While interesting for scholars, as I glanced thru this version - which is watered down but still white hot with anger - I was struck at how far off base the predictions of the man seem today. Afterall, when it was written, Japan was at the crest of the bubble economy, it appeared as if Japanese computer chips (and its electronic industries) would confer great power on the country (they could refuse to sell components that went into US missiles), and the US was in a now-unimaginable phase of self doubt. As such, the way things have turned out, after nearly 16 years of stagnation and the rise of high tech manufacturer-competitors elsewhere, reveal the author to have been so badly mistaken regarding the trajectory that Japan would take as to be laughable. 

In a deeper sense, it points to the fact that Ishihara did not understand the economic forces at work at the time and so was full of utterly baseless nationalistic bravado. Japan's economic rise was based upon the post-war reconstruction boom, then a relatively protected economy that allowed huge undustrial combines to band together as cartels (gouging their won consumers to sell at low prices abroad to gain marketshare and crush competitiors), and lastly to a number of significant management innovations (TQM, just-in-time manufacturing, etc.) that are reflected in the fact that they make excellent cars. However, it was basically a follower economy making products that have become commoditized by cheaper manufacturers elsewhere in Asia - just as its innovations became widely emulated - and corrupted by the money generated in real estate speculation that eventually collapsed in a deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, its political reforms have been weak at best, and senselessly nationalistic at worst. 

Ishihara understood none of this and casts no light on any of it of value. Instead, he drags out pre-WWII arguments about the innate superiority of the Japanese character and similar rather ugly arguments. He is also appalingly loose with the facts: for example, he claims that the US bombed Japan, but not Germany with the atom bomb for racist reasons (Japanese were yellow, Germans were not) - but if you know a minimum of history, which Isihara apparently doesn't, you would realise that at the time of the German defeat (April, 1945) the bomb was not yet completed (it was first test detonated the following July)! The book is full of this kind of sloppiness. What he does succeed at, however, is expressing the resentment that parochial Japanese nationalists felt at the time. In retrospect, his arrogance appears as breathtaking as it is ignorant. But his anger and resentment, and what they reflect of Japanese attitudes, is very real indeed. Seen this way, the book is one long crypto-racist rant.

1e5f518e1911559c,"Deleting: Max Katsarelas 

It upsets me terribly that you found it necessary to delete a page created for Max Katsarelas.  You obviously didn't read my rebuttal to dispute the deletion. You display the insight of a 100 year old women that has suffered from Alzheimer's for 20 years. You don't even deserve a user page you PC using paper pusher.  I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet, you'd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980's. Additionally, why don't I tag your username for a copyright infringement? If it's true that you're a fan of The Simpsons, then I may never watch the show again knowing someone of your character partakes in the humor of Homer's comedic stylings.

So as you probably read through this and decide you're going to delete everything I have just taken the time to write, I'd like to know a few things. 

1. Do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in? If you did, I would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion- you had diarrhea. Aint it just the worse?

2. Are you married or still living in your mother's basement? It was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mother's basement, because, hey, most wikipedians do anyways. However, the point is, if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man, I'm sure, in fact, 100% positive you would not have tagged Max Katsarelas' page for deletion. I think it's time you get some poon. You don't know what poon is?  Here you go, read about it.

3. Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? Just curious.

4. Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians? 

For the record, I will continue to post Max Katsarelas' page up because I have kept the copy I wrote and I want to prove to you and my fellow visitors of the page what little lives you wikipedians have. 

Good Day.

A tag has been placed on Grandfield Lutheran Church, Sheyenne, ND, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Borders: It's close enough but I wish it's possible to use increasingly lighter shades. E.g., You've followed the present-day border, more or less, for the Chinese border, which I suppose is a reasonable representation of the """"line of control"""". But the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line. Anaukpetlun and Thalun controlled some of Koshanpye (1622-1626 campaigns) on top of present-day Shan State and east of Bhamo (though not as extensive or deeper into Yunnan as did Bayinnaung); likewise, all the sawbwas in modern Kachin State and sawbwas in northern Shan State also paid dual tribute. But since it's not technically feasible, I guess we'll just have to provide an explanation on this.
 A number of locations are offsome by a lot. Chiang Mai, Ava, Kyaukse, Nyangshwe, Pegu and Kale.
 Also please add the cities of Nan and Chaing Saen in Lan Na. Nan was the easternmost possession. Chaing Saen (Kyaing Thin) was the capital of northern Lan Na. (The Burmese divided Lan Na into two.)

Because of the constant """"doubt is our product"""" propaganda from the tobacco industry, the public did not fully become cognizant of the risk until thirty years after the science was solid.

We don't know anything about the atmosphere, so it's not really as cut and dried as you might initially think.  I agree with you that some of the media coverage has been a bit more cheerleader-ish than is warranted, and don't particularly want to see that stuff in the article either.  What would be useful to incorporate is a presentation of the literature's discussion of what would be required for Gl 581 c to actually be habitable.  The Selsis paper has a pretty nice treatment, although it's a bit scattered here and there  still worth a pretty close look if you get a chance.  G'nite; I'll look forward to continuing this tomorrow!

I have come to the conclusion that Wikipedia is no different than any other source of misinformation. My intentions of contributing to the Whitman article was due to my involvement with the officer who killed Whitman and numerous victims, professors, witnesses and news media outlets. But Alas, I find myself, as Gulliver, lost among a few Yahoos whose intentions appear to be to their own speculation and interpretation of Charles Whitman and The University of Texas Tower Tragedy. Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules, in the face of facts and researched knowledge. They are pedantic and callous, and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level; I must now re-elevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking, something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted. I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson; that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject, there are always those who no nothing, willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions. I will take away all my contributions. I realize they will be re-inserted for the Yahoos benefit, but that will be out of my hands!

Continuous integration has a longer history than this article indicates.  Integration has been performed on software projects for a long time.  A number of the elements that are now seen as continuous integration were described by Booch. 

In the context of continuously integrating a system's architecture, establish a projects rhythm by driving to closure certain artifacts at regular intervals

He then goes on to say there are three parts to this:

First, the macro process of object-oriented development is one of """"continuous integration."""". Rather than set aside a period of formal testing at the end of the life-cycle, the object-orientated life cycle tends to integrate the parts of software (and possibly hardware) at more regular intervals...

Second, at regular intervals, the process of continuous integration yields executable releases that grow in functionality each release...

His final part is that by having integration more frequently quality can be assessed by management, risks can be identified and acted-upon early.

This is hardly anything to base a claim on of someone being an authority on the TEN-string guitar. Also, anyone with musical knowledge can compare the quality of my own editions on my site and those by Janet Marlow and see who is the authority.

Anyway, I have the support of Fritz Buss, who studied with Yepes between 1960 and 1986 and whom Yepes considered """"an excellent guitarist with a wonderful technique but also a deep musician aware of his responsibility and always in search of more knowledge and perfection"""" as well as considering Buss one of the three best guitar teachers in the word . And Fritz Buss has written that """"Viktor van Niekerk is a conscious artist with a total understanding of the ten-string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes."""" And I have the autographed documents to prove it. So, Andrew, if you have something constructive (some actual knowledge) to contibute, then please do so. But this is nothing more than a personal vendetta against me for speaking out against individuals who have been publishing misinformation.

We all know that Brando was openly bisexual and had affairs with James Dean and Wally Cox, but it is a fact that he was also a pedophile.

Tarita even includes extracts from Cheyenne's diary in which she mentions the sexual abuse her father subjected her to.

However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.

The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Resolution Must be Made

I have been an observer of this article on Abbas Babei since the start of this conflict. I want to point out that we this issue needs to be solved otherwise both users will face blocks. Hooperag has offered a proposal that makes logical sense, Imagine this was the article of Barack Obama, we can't just say: """"Obama is notorious for his merciless treatment towards the minters of parliament who oppose his policies"""" (that's a totally random example, but whatever). It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like """"Babaei was """"notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" considered disloyal to the new regime"""", you include some background info on who made that statement (add more context). The word """"merciless"""" is very subjective (opinion based) and if it is to be used you can't use it as if it was fact based, when you say """"Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100% true fact that he was merciless.
 For these reasons I suggest we rephrase the sentence to be something along the lines of Hooperag's suggestion whish was to rephrase it something like this: """"According to the famous historian Tom Cooper whom interviewed various Iranian pilots, Abbas Babaei was considered """"merciless"""" in his treatment towards pilots disloyal to the new regime"""".

I wish to make it clear that I do not endorse any party, neither Hooperag nor the IP. However the proposal sounds reasonable and has been the only proposal to resolve this dispute so far.If this issue is not resolved with in the next 24 hours or so and the conflict continues, I will request to an admin that both users be blocked.134.39.77.59

 death 

I think there are various explanations on how chinggis died in the different sources. Some say he fell from a horse, others allege a connection to a XiXia princess, one(?) goes into detail and sais that this princess severed the small Genghis. I think incorporating this into the article would be better than leaving it at the current """"unknown reasons"""". I'll try to find the exact citations until tomorrow. Heissig's Ein Volk sucht seine Geschichte should be OK, I assume?   

 Spelling of name 

The article says:

""""Genghis"""" as popularly spelled and pronounced in Western media and text is supposedly derived from the original Persian reports of an invading army, led by a man in 1219 against the Khwarezmid Empire. The Persian people pronounced the man's name """"Genghis"""", as there was no """"ch"""" sound in the Persian tongue. Henceforth, the Persian version of the name of the leader of the Mongol Empire became known and widespread in the Western hemisphere as """"Genghis"""".[citation needed]

This is absolute nonsense.  There is a """"ch"""" sound in Persian (e.g. chahar, four).  The spelling """"Genghis"""" is more likely to have come from Marco Polo attempting to render the sound of Chinese.  It might be worth pointing out that, in that case, the initial G should be pronounced j or zh, and not like """"get"""" as so many people do.   

Do we have a source either way? If not, then this kind of speculation is Original Research, and needs to be removed (that's why there is a [citation needed] there in the first place).   

I've found a review that attributes the Genghis/Persian theory to Weatherford, and also refutes it based on historical documents. Therefore I've fixed the text in the article to explain that disagreement and pointing to the relevant source.   

Genghis is not Western but the English, French and Spanish spelling, note it's written and pronounced with a """"ch"""" [ʧ] in Russian (Ч),  Mongolian (Ч), Tartar (Ç) and also German (Dsch-). The English spelling should follow the Russian, Mongolian and Tartar for this word, IMO.   

German pronounciation is actually more like Jingis, with J as in Jungle.   

The English name is and remains Genghis. It is not up to Wikipedia to decide whether it """"should"""" be or follow anything different.   

Above statement is wrong. Genghis is almost never used in newly published (scholarly) books and articles in English these days. Most common spelling is Chingiz. Chingis also used. Genghis is now reserved for childrens' books and journalists, Wikipedia should change to reflect this.

I have never seen anyone use Chingiz. Chinggis, Činggis etc. yes, but not Chingiz.   

Looked at some sources and I was wrong above - Chinggis is most common, followed by Chingis and Chingiz in roughly equal second place. No matter how commonly Genghis is used in English, there's no escaping that it's wrong. 212.135.195.50

Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer
in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked
by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort.

""""Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. 

But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. 

The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) 

I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. 

Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to """"work with"""" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). 

This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. 

This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. 

It will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. 

I know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fert",0,0,0,0,0,0

The answer to your question in Gaulish language is that the so-called Vulgar Latin, which should be called a Latinized Italo-Celtic idiom instead because the spoken language of the Romans (Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic language and not Latin, already essentially a written language) the 'Proto-Italian' was so similar to the Continental Celtic languages that only the lexicon and the pronunciation differed a bit, and could almost be considered a dialect of Gaulish as it contained the same substratum, unlike the Insular Celtic languages. 

So, in reality no one can assert that Gaulish is an extinct language because we don't know enough about it before the Roman conquest and probably many 'Latin' words were already used by the Gauls before their first contact with the conquerers. At the most 'assimilation' could better describe what happened to that language. Both, the Proto-Italics and the Proto-Celts (Veneti) originally come from the Bell-Beaker culture and lived in a dialect continuum for a long time. In fact, Celtic is more a culture (brought by a Thraco-Cimmerian aristocracy) than a language family except for Brythonic and Gaelic languages which are both quite different from each other because of their respective substratum as mentionned above. Moreover, Proto-English (or Proto-Frisian) spoken by the Belgae was already used in Britain as well as in some parts of northern Gaul (Gallia Belgica) by the time of the Roman invasion, then the Belgic tribes just kept speaking the same language during and after the Roman time.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ehh, there was a misadventure a while back where my buddy Biruitorul and I were amusing ourselves by satirizing the ongoing dramatic soap opera that is Wikipedia in the form of a gloriously overwrought naval epic (Horatio Hornblower meets Dr. Strangelove.) It was a lot of fun, we caricatured ourselves just as mercilessly as we did our antagonists, brought in one ludicrous plot twist after another (in one chapter, some Arrow Cross pirates boarded my ship and tied me up, meanwhile Biru had been seized by even more religious fervor than usual and was heading off to retake Constantinople for Orthodoxy.

 Inappropriate editing 

Sir, your edits to KUSI-TV violate Wikipedia's Conflict of Interest (COI) policy. You work for the station. Wikipedia would rather individuals work on articles that are not about them, their family, companies they work for, etc.
In addition, you are making misleading claims, and adding content that seems more """"advertising"""" in nature.
You have said that the company is owned by """"McKinnon Broadcasting of Texas."""" No such entity existist. The station is owned by:
Channel 51 of San Diego, Inc.:

    * 66.26% - Michael D. McKinnon

Khalid is greatest general of all time, arguably.  Alexander is the second greatest general. For example, compare battle of Nihawand to Guagamela. Archaemenids recovered, Sassanids never recovered. In Yarmouk, Khalid outnumbered 10 to 1 but still victorious! He did not inherit an army, like Alexander's macedonian army from King Philip. He vanquished Persia and devastated Byzantium in 6 years! Plus he was many times outnumbered. None of these factors apply to Napoleon or Hannibal or Alexander. Acknowledge facts and logical truth. Dont become biased because Khalid was a muslim.

There are several points in the current article that are designed to distort who I am or my work.  The lede says I'm an """"embed on assignment in Iraq"""".  I've spent just as much time in Iraq.   I'm not nor have I ever been a blogger.  I've never """"blogged"""" and yet the article claims blogging and commentary citing my participation in Fox Forums.  The truth is that I've written far more hard news for Foxnews.com and have only participated in Fox Forum when requested to by the editor.  The current focus of the article on blogging is meant to minimize my credentials as a reporter.  I'm also likened to Rich Merritt and Jeff Gannon.  Two comparisons that are meant to smear me and are also awkwardly placed in the article

You said that I should not be drawn into petty disputes but these issues have been in the article for two years and despite many protests no one has even bothered to answer why or how these comments have been put into the article.  Could you ask for some explanation or move to have the wording replaced?  Also, there was an image of Ann Coulter and myself in the article and it was removed.

Yes, not necessarily after every sentence especially if the sentences deal with the very same thing and this is a very long article. Every paragraph should have one though. If you look at the chapter """"Battle of Tampere"""" for example, the first three paragraphs have no citations but the last two have. If it's the case that that they've simply been split up to smaller paragraphs, we could use the same citation at several places with text  + .
I'm not criticizing the work done on this article, I'm just worried because I want to let it stay as FA-class. I think part of the problem could be that the article might be getting too long. For such a general presentation on the war, not every section has to be very exact. It makes citating harder and some of the chapters look really long which doesn't make them look too attractive to read. As film directors say, it is as important to decide what to leave out as it is important what to put in. Do you think the article might have got too long on some parts? ' """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks, I found it at Amazon yesterday so thought I'd have a go at uploading it. I like what you've done with the quote. I think the background is the appropriate place to discuss the response to what Hedren claims. I'm not sure whether we need to include the Telegraph article in the criticism section now as it's mentioned earlier, so I'll take that bit out. You can always restore it if you don't agree though. Another thing we may need to add is some viewing figures for the film's US and UK television debuts. Finding them for the UK seems quite straightforward, but I can't seem to track them down for the US. If you can help with that it would be much appreciated. Cheers   13:26",0,0,0,0,0,0

The aim of this article (and any other Wikipedia article) is that it accurately reflect reliably sources.  Since intelligent design is a fringe subject, it's also important that we don't present it as it were mainstream science.  
There are atheists (and even a few agnostics) that considered ID a viable hypothesis long before the Discovery Institute was founded.

 YOUR CONCEPT OR RACE IS LUDRICOUS

   You showed a picture of Collin Powell? hahaha. That's not what I meant by """" white-skin"""" Dominicans. Collin Powell( a Mulatto, btw) is FAR from being """" white-skinned"""". I placed the suffix """" -skinned"""" on purpose. I meant by that, is that even when there is a mixture, the amount of European blood is much larger, thus giving the person """" White skin"""" and more European-like characteristics.

""""African descent""""?
If a model's race must be stipulated (although I don't see why it should be, since black plus-size models do very well in the industry, and are not particularly seen less often than Caucasian plus-size models), wouldn't it be better to say that a model is """"black"""" rather than """"of African descent""""? A good faith suggestion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.215.23.237   

 It is relevant to denote her race in terms of the cosmetics work with Cover Girl; I strongly disagree that black models are 'not particularly seen less often than caucasian models' in this style of model work or any other, especially in an international context.  Although they may do 'as well' relatively, the amount of work is markedly less than that for caucasian models outside of the U.S.  Tesfay was born in Canada of Eritrean descent so the common descriptor """"African American"""" is erroneous.  To make it simple, 'black' it is.   

Link Spam
Not sure where to look on Wiki for the answer to this, so I'll ask here: when does a web link become web spam?  When the link breaks, or merely when someone notices that links have been added to an article?  For an article needing to find more sources, recent removals of all weblinks seems a bit overzealous to me.   

CALENDARS
The whole calendar paragraph is problematic now, I think; too big for the article relative to its significance. It's not possible to rank these along with ANTM, print magazines, etc., any more than online magazines, because they don't have anything like the same kind of public reach, and the naming of specific calendars in the first place invites spam. Since 2007, the year of the named calendars, is (nearly) over, and they haven't become annual publications, I think the paragraph should be cut back to refer to the launch of several calendars in general, without naming specifics, otherwise there's the impossible requirement of defining exactly what is or is not a notable calendar.  Also, the sentence about fostering a healthier industry attitude is too generic and applies to many projects involving plus-size models, not just these calendars. You'd need to repeat the same sentence in nearly every item in the article if it appears here. I recommend something like, """"2007 was the launch year for several grassroots calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, spurring similar projects in the following year.""""
Perhaps to be named, a calendar would have to merit its own Wiki entry, and undergo an AfD discussion.   
 I do not understand why you are trying to compare TV shows with consumer products and it is disingenuous of you to want to.  MODE no longer exists, should that be expunged from the article too?  I agree to a certain point about modifying the mention of calendars, however there are good media references available for the Fenomenal Calendar and this article sorely needs every good source link it can get.  The originators of a market niche are worth noting IMO; the rest are just jumping on the bandwagon (in terms of seeking self-promotion, not in production quality or financial returns) and certainly none of them yet are at the aesthetic level of Fenomenal, no matter what opinion one may hold on the theme of the styling, size of the models, or comparisons between unrelated other print products, such as MODE Magazine for example.  Further, I do not believe it necessary for a single mention to undergo AfD or else every model named to their own paragraph on this article should do the same.  I would think that a Fenomenal weblink is appropriate because the homepage remains visible online.  This calendar does set the standard for commercially-available calendar products; in the absence of Elena Miro's calendar remaining online for people to see, which in any case was never available for purchase and should only be considered a promotional item - anything other in comparison is apples and turnips.

 Suggestion: """"2007 was the launch year for several [link=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homegrown homegrown] calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, including the well-received (media reflink) Fenomenal Calendar (weblink).

The trouble is that we can´t find an usable way to do it, getting links in the tree. I've used HTML lists, but they don't make the cut. Tables are difficult to edit and correct. I was trying to do it with timelines, which may come in handy, but it's not as intuitive for non-tech people to edit later.

Part III

What's with blanking out the names completely? So much for compromise. I'm going back to COUNTING the pre-1925 champions. Here's why:

1. The outside sources, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, list them.

2. All the arguments that could be made against the pre-1925 French tournament could also be made against the other three.

3. The idea of the """"slam"""" didn't even emerge until the 1930s, with Don Budge...but do we see anyone black out pre-1938 Wimbledon champs?

4. It's clear that the French tournament was MORE open...their first champ was a Brit, as was two runners-up in the early decades. Interestingly, the US """"Open"""" in 1881 was open only to Americans, and was for several years. Yet we count them, because that's the origin of the tournament.

5. There's also the pro-am dispute, pre-1968. 

6. Wikipedia is supposed to reflect pluralistic viewpoints, not just the one of one person such as Fyunclick who violates WP:OWN to contort this and similar tennis articles to reflect his own views, rather than reflecting outside sources that existed long before Wikipedia did.

 Per WP:ADJECTIVE and WP:MOSNAME, we use nouns and noun-phrases for article titles, not adjectives.  So a general survey on the relationships between Christianity and Judaism (a topic this encyclopedia should certainly cover) should be called Christianity and Judaism, as per the articles Christianity and Islam, Islam and Judaism.
 The reason the article Judeo-Christian exists, as its own hatnote declares, is specifically to survey the history and use of that word-phrase  which has its own controversy, and its own tale to tell.  (See here where I've set things out in a bit more detail.)  That story is a good fit for its own article, and will get completely lost if the contents of Christianity and Judaism get inappropriately dumped on top of it.

Having contacted the closing admin, his advice was to open a new discussion at Talk:Christianity and Judaism, advertise the discussion widely, and if a new consensus can be reached in that discussion [his emphasis], then per WP:CCC the new consensus should be followed, rather than the AfD decision, without the need for a DRV or a new AfD.

Concerns about the proposed merge have also been expressed by ,  and .

This post is therefore to let you know that that discussion is underway, at Talk:Christianity and Judaism#Overly speedy deletion, with a view to perhaps setting aside the AfD decision.

 A Brief History *
The """"ID Cabal"""" or """"IDCab"""" meme was started by blocked user Moulton on Wikipedia Review. It has been taken up with gusto by Lara Love, Cla68, and others. Now Kelly has embraced it. There has been an Rfc (started by members of the Intelligent Design Wikiproject) to get people to cease this bad-faith smearing, but it didn't get very far. The three most supported views were basically """"labels are bad"""" """"waste of time"""" and """"WP Not a Battelground"""". all of which might indicate that labeling people and using any excuse to attack others with that label is bad, but the Rfc was a waste of time. I presume by now you've read my initial paragrah and the linked edits, and see taht my post had nothing to do with intelligent design; that I addressed two editors who had been warring, and Kelly chose to personalize the dispute - see reported by MastCell (Result: Declined because of lack of consensus)

Hi there,

Thanks for the message.
I have only altered music data which I'm 100% sure of, such as Roy Orbison pages, etc.  I've been collecting music data since July 1960, therefore have a high degree of knowledge where music is concerned.

Someone has mentioned to me a person with the sirname 'Derbyshire'.  I don't know anyone with the last name 'Derbyshire'.

I contributed to the Guiness Book of British Hit Singles and Albums for many years {you'll find my name - Russtti Gaynor - listed in many of the final copies, until Virgin took over in 2006.

 Leave in Greenfield, MA 350.org Event Incident 

Since there are a whole list of *future* """"positive"""" things listed, such as kids making pretty things, people on bikes with fancy armbands, and people planting trees, I thought it would not be out-of-line to list a negative event that *actually* occurred at a 350.org demonstration.  It's hard on the one hand to say that this event wasn't related to 350.org but then include all these other events that are just as related.  There are plenty of mentions of negative signs in the articles on Tea Party and 9/12 demonstrations.  Did the organizers of those events intend for those signs to be there?  No.  Are they worth mentioning?  Yes.  It's pretty notable that one of these events featured a threat to a person.  Bounties on private citizens don't go up every day.  This article is a lot like an ad, but I guess that's the intent of the most persistent Wikipedia editors. If it puts them in a positive light, it's totally relevant and notable.

5390201b424c4563,"""If Canada abolished the monarchy or changed the succession rules it would have no impact on the UK. Conversely, if the UK were to change its succession rules and Canada maintained the status quo, we would be faced with the possibility of having to completely change our system to accomodate a resident monarchy - when our political system and constitution are not designed for an absentee monarch (hence the position of governor general which does not exist in the UK). TAB 

The """"British monarchy"""" is """"first among equals"""" in political terms as the abolition of the monarchy in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc would have no impact on the monarchy in Britain whereas the abolition of the monarchy in the UK would almost certainly lead to its extinction in the rest of the Commonwealth Realms.

The fact is that the system in the """"Commonwealth Realms"""" (outside of the UK) was designed with the assumption that the monarch would be resident in London. Do you deny that?TAB

The fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in Britain. She has spent 2% of her reign in Canada and, I suspect, around that percentage or less in the other Commonwealth Realms.TAB

The fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a) her British subjects and the British political system and b) her subjects and the political systems in the other Commonwealth realms.

The most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the Governor General in the Commonwealth Realms is played by the Queen herself in Britain. i.e. The Queen, with increasingly rare exceptions, does not give royal assent to bills passed in Commonwealth legislatures or even give the Throne Speech (what in Britain is called the Queen's Speech because the Queen herself gives it). She does not name the Prime Ministers in Commonwealth Realms, does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in Commonwealth Realms and does not have weekly meetings with her Commonwealth PMs.TAB

Now monarchists like to believe that the Queen is fully informed and intimately involved in, let's say, Canadian affairs. The reality is that in the Commonwealth Realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity, much more so than in Britain.TAB

Let me give you a hard example. We now know that the Queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in Australia in 1975. This was done by Governor General Kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happened.TAB

Let me give you another example. We now know thanks to the 30 year disclosure rule that the Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in Britain complaining of this or that government policy (this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being """"above politics""""). We also know from biographies and autobiographies that UK Prime Ministers do give some consideration to what the Queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister. It may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture. That is simply not the case for Commonwealth Realm PMs. There is no evidence of royals writing Canadian or Austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of Canadian or Australian PMs being particularly concerned about what the Queen might think, at least not to the extent as is the case in the UK. TAB

Now you might say but the Governor General acts on HMs behalf so there's really no difference. But there is, the Queen's role in the UK is unmediated, in the realms it is mediated by a GG and she is almost a complete absentee from the process.TAB

Therefore, it's quite clear that her role is much more important in the UK than elsewhere. 

Also, the fact that the systems in the Commonwealth Realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a GG in place Britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where Commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the Queen's role in the UK. 

The fact is if Britain became a republic the Commonwealth Realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the Windsors, or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where, say, she spends one month in each realm.TAB

The fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family's wishes, including the possibility that they would not want to move to Canada or Australia but would prefer to either remain in a British republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in Europe (or even the US). That would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new mon",0,0,0,0,0,0

c00312648aa37372,"Just look at the stuff about David Irving and how many times the author tries to smear this honourable historian, whose book 'Hitlers War' from 1977 was compulsery reading at West Point and Sandhurst. This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.

However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free. Whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice, the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event.

I find David irving to be a good and honourable englishman. His father was naval officer who took part in The Battle of Jutland. You cannot find ANY factual fault in his work. If you can David is the first who wants to know - email him.

By the way, he do not deny the holocaust, which is why your Wikipedia entry is so wrong. He find the whole subject boring, but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts, poles,russians,gypsies and others got killed.

 NCCC and crossing the line 

I didn't read the entirety of this post yet, but I can tell you already that you crossed the line. So shortly after I cautioned that it was unwise to call names, you called LoverOfArt intellectually dishonest, incompetent, """"or both"""". This is plainly and unequivocally unacceptable.

You're going to have trouble maintaining credibility in this from here on out. Dbiel and I have both asked you to try and work with the group instead of blatantly against it. Dbiel explained why he thought we should start from a shortened article, and we've acknowledged all along that the criticisms section is a point of contention and needs to be addressed. And LoverOfArt, while he has been stand-offish, has not been nearly as contentious or offensive as you have.

You had a chance to work peacefully and neutrally with other editors, and you stubbornly rejected it in favor of pushing your point of view, at the expense of civility and your own credibility. I do not expect this to end well for you.

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.

58d67ba8d7ba4e5f,"""   Regarding the """"Speedy Deletion"""" of my entry for The Resonance Project

I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper """"talk"""" process.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

d1faea1274cd94c7,"If you read the most thorough and credible works on the subject (see below), you will see that not only did the so-called Zebra murders flow directly from NOI theology, but that they were an NOI operation, directed from Chicago (aka New Mecca), and run out of the San Francisco mosque. The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.

The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.

The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.

To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.

Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.

The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.
 
Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.

Contrary to those who have claimed that the NOI was seeking with the killings to cause a race war, the NOI was prosecuting a race war. The real story of how that war was stopped is one that I’m afraid we’ll never learn.

Jorfer's complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0.999... = 1 .  His issue, rather, is rather the concept of limits actually """"applies"""" to """"real life"""".

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.

80328cc047f94488,". The obvious mistake in the inadequate use of “prosecute” in the translation of the French Rabbinate can be analysed as an unconscious confession and denunciation of the falsification committed by the rabbinical ancestors.

TABFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.

TABBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.

TABAbolishing the commandment of Abraham, the Second Commandment makes the right to physical integrity the first of the rights of man. One can even think that in the Third Commandment that comes right after this condemnation of circumcision:

“You will not invoke the name of the Eternal your God to support lie...” (20: 7, French Rabbinate),

Moses reproaches Abraham for having perjured saying that God would have ascribed him circumcision. A shrewd reader of the Bible, Mohammed took up this accusation in verses 4: 118-119 of the Koran (see below). For if God ever ordered Abraham circumcision, he forbade Moses to do it. Either it was not the same God or he changed his mind between both Alliances, or still Abraham lied and no God ever ordered circumcision. The Book of the Deuteronomy confirms that God did not impose circumcision to Moses",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi - two or more stub types which you created have been nominated for deletion or renaming at Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion. The stub types (templates or categories), which were not proposed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, do not meet the standard requirements for a stub type, either through being incorrectly named, ambiguously scoped, or through failure to meet standards relating to the current stub hierarchy or likely size, as explained at Wikipedia:Stub. Please feel free to make any comments at WP:SFD regarding these stub types, and in future, please consider proposing new stub types first!

It is worth noting that stub templates are virtually never created for independentist regions until such time that they are recognised internationally by a significant number of countries, as these stub types tend to become the targets of potential edit-warring (something which has far more far-reaching effects on templates than it has on articles). Thus, for example, there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus, since it is only recognised by one country. If Abkhazia and South Ossetia become recognised by more than just one country, then feel free to propose the creation of stub types for them. Until then, it is generally accepted practice with stub sorting for them not to have separate stub types. ...wha? """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

GA Sweeps Review: On Hold
As part of the WikiProject Good Articles, we're doing sweeps to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the GA criteria. I'm specifically going over all of the """"World History-Americas"""" articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a Good article. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed. I have made multiple corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and if progress is being made then the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Here are the points that need to be addressed:
Expand the lead to better summarize the article. It should mention a little bit about each heading within the article. The current two sentences isn't sufficient in describing the article. For guidelines, see WP:LEAD. The first paragraph in the background sections reads like part of the lead, consider rewording part of it and merging it into the current lead.
""""Many subsequent historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus either characterized Hamilton as """"suicidal"""", Burr as """"malicious and murderous,"""" or both."""" Single sentence shouldn't stand alone. Either expand on it or incorporate it into another paragraph. Go through the rest of the article and fix any other occurrences.
""""When the original pistol was examined, the concealed hair trigger was discovered. (Reference: """"Pistols shed light on famed duel,"""" Smithsonian magazine, November 1976)"""" This reference should be converted to an inline citation.
This is not required, but consider converting the url inline citations to the templates used at WP:CITET.

Needs inline citations:
""""The most famous duel in American history..."""" If this is going to be stated a citation needs to be included.
""""...partook in """"hooliganish"""" behavior in..."""" If """"hooliganish"""" is in quotation marks, then it needs to have a source directly after the sentence.
""""There, after much debate and tight gridlocking, the influence of Alexander Hamilton, a very respected Federalist persuaded Federalists that Jefferson was the lesser of two evils.""""

What you suggest, some form of moral policing I suppose, is utterly wrong. Who would determine what reliable sources are reporting in a way seemingly transphobic? Also, I believe there is a previous administrative action case of Wikipedians describing fellow editors asIslamophobic, because it's very close to a personal attack (especially as some people felt it concerns commenting another editor's mental state, an accusation of a medical phobia). In any case, it's not very good for the community that people are calling other editors -phobic or the other way """"politically correct liberals"""".

Ketamine500mg Inj 10ml Rotex Germany$25.00
Ketamine250mg Inj 5ml Indus $15.00
Ketamine 50mg Inj 2ml Indus $5.00

The 5000mg bottle = 10 (10ml) viles.  That breaks out to 5 grams powder. One 10ml vile breaks out into half a gram of powder.

It's real easy to get the liquid into powder if you don't know how to do it.  Just put it on a plate and boil water underneath it until it evaporates, then you'll be left with the powder.  You can also put the liquid on pyrex in the oven.  Be careful not to heat the liquid anymore than once it's gone otherwise you'll burn your shit.

This article will never be a FA nor a good article. It also had been the victim of some wikipedia rules that don't apply to other articles on this encyclopedia. When I first started to edit on wiki I was quite enthusiastic but later this feeling faded. For example the artcle had been moved to a name that is not used in the world of football. Steaua had always been known for its official name: FC Steaua Bucureşti. This name is used worldwide to refer to Steaua. I personally found this situation annoying and I suggest that a move should take place. I mean, the other Romanian football clubs with Bucureşti in their naming were not moved and those awkward wikipedia rules applied only to this article. 

Here are some examples about football clubs that have articles based on their official club names:

 Sporting Clube de Portugal
 Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F.
 F.C. Internazionale Milano
 Olympique Lyonnais
 Deportivo de La Coruña
 Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata

e4d907f77d1156ab,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0
6170dd60fd891217,"In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”
 
Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same. If we leave this lie as it is, it will certainly give a bad influence to the US-Japan relation.”",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've great respect for GwenGale. I don't, however, have any respect whatsoever for the preposterous, not to say idiotic, rules and policies of WP. That and that alone makes me unsuitable for editing any WP article whatsoever. I also think that it is those very rules and policies that gut any integrity a so called minority view article could ever have. The only thing the WP rules and policies have accomplished at the AS article is to prevent useful, important and thoroughly verified information to be included, at the same time irrelevant and factually false claims have been inflated and scattered all through the article. There is no integrity there, very little informative value and a high degree of distortion. If that is the WP idea of """"integrity"""", then that is an integrity not worth protecting. And isn't WP supposed to the free and public encyclopedia? If that is the case, why should we be bound by any dictates from Jimmy Wales? We are the editors, not him. He may have founded it, but we are the ones upholding it. By the logic employed by some editors here, the government should be allowed to have total control of the internet, because it was government that """"created"""" the internet. That is the principle WP seems to follow, and I reject that principle.

 Question about human name dabs 

This question concerns two disambig guidelines: (1) a disambig page should not include a red link unless the editor is confident that the subject is notable enough for an article, but (2) red links should be included for items that link to the disambig page without any of the available options in mind.

Yes, I forgot to address the amendment to include criticisms issue. Based on my reasoning concerning Clinton's statement, the criticisms are equally irrelevant and should not be included (in my humble opinion). To Mdiamante - I realize this is not Lexis. However, I think we can set a good precedent in the legal articles by refraining as much as possible from POV editing. I've always criticized Wikipedia based on its lack of reliability and blatant bias, but when I came across this article I thought """"Wow, maybe this is a topic I can help contribute to without all of the POV nonsense."""" Then, of course, I saw the Dred Scott section and thought """"shit."""" It's not so much that I don't think ANY cases or legal topics should include sections/statements from groups/individuals unconnected to the legal community. Indeed, it would be insane to make such a claim, given the almost-revolutionary impact of some cases - not just on society, but on legal thought. See, e.g., Roe (which, by the way, I was pleasantly surprised with). Rather, I just think some are not, and this happens to be one of them. Perhaps my opinion would be different if old Bill had supported his statement with some sort of reasoning, but he clearly did not. It was just a conclusory assertion; something my mother might say in a fit of anger. But alas, this is not a battle I'm going to wage. I will continue browsing legal articles when I get some time and decide if the POV is decidedly less prevalent than in other areas. If so, I'd love for Wikipedia to become a hobby.65.247.226.99  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for that response, and I will benefit from the additional information. I do however believe the entire reporting process is better served if this unintentional obstruction is corrected. Regardless of whether or not a report would have been more appropriately filed somewhere else, the misplaced report having been filed in good faith, deserves to receive the attention on an admin. Honestly, I would expect an admin to rather zealously ensure, that they weren't taken out of the loop, by the flaw of an automated process. I believe the timestamp should be compared, and if the report is after the block in place, the report should stay. Manually remove if without action, or when the block is modified, the Bot would remove it then. Unless it was a technical challenge beyond what I can fathom, I see little reason not to. And I know a couple tool admins who love to hate fixing code. So I stand upon the initial belief that this is a problematic condition, I am curious if there is something I am missing entirely?

 Peter Birks 

Dear Legis

I have had to revert most of the edits made to the article Peter Birks because they were virtually indistinguishable from Jack Beatson, 'Peter Birks' (Obituary), The Guardian (16 July 2004), accessed 18 August 2009. You appear to be the editor who was responsible for reproducing a large quantity of copyright material in this article. I am surprised to find this kind of editing being done by a lawyer with a first-class degree. Just to show to what an extent you had plagiarised the material, compare:

He became regius professor of civil law at Oxford University and a fellow of All Souls College in 1989, having held chairs at Edinburgh (1981-87) and, briefly, at Southampton. Before that, he was a tutorial fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford (1971-81), a strong law college to which he remained very close, and taught at University College London.

He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1989, and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, his undergraduate college, in 1994; ... He was made an honorary Queen's counsel in 1995, and served as president of the Society of Legal Scholars in 2002-03. He lectured and taught throughout the Commonwealth and in Europe. (The Guardian)

... [Birks,] with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, [was] a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (The Guardian)

Birks, together with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, was a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (Your edit)

And so it continues, including the lifting, almost wholesale, of this paragraph:

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. This held, for the first time, that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities are not entitled to them. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but, possibly because the lawyers had adopted his arguments without attribution, the judgments do not refer to the essay. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described the essay as """"powerful"""". (The Guardian)

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. In that case the courts [synonymous with The Guardian's original, 'This'] held, for the first time in English law [you add 'in English law'], that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities had no legal right to levy them [again, synonymous with the original]. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but the judgments did not refer to his writing (some critics suggest this was because the lawyers adopted his arguments without attribution) [you move a subordinate clause from the middle of the sentence to the end, varying the wording just slightly]. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described his writings [='the essay'] as """"powerful"""". (Your edit)

You copy a bit more copyright material, and at the end of the article even clumsily leave in, '· Peter Brian Herrenden Birks, academic lawyer, born October 3 1941; died July 6 2004'.

Disappointing editing from a highly educated member of the legal profession.

I am not MataNui44. You people speak english, I know that, but you have to read the context before you accuse and block. (To Hersford) I will not disclose personal info on the open internet.

(To Acroterion) This blocking evasion stuff is getting old. You have no evidence to even prove that MataNui44 and I are in the same hemisphere, so until you do please silence that argument, as it has gotten annoying. This talk of MataNui44 being me because of the time and langauge I started editing with has no evidence to support your claims of me being MataNui, and running a conspiracy to evade the block to which is on his account. An internal source is in my opinion reliable, and if that wasn't enough it had links at that page itself. The ambiguity you claim of is not existant, and my editting times are simply coincidental. Seriously though, I would like to see some proof that he and I are the same person, as the way you've talked about me with pronouns I'm having an identity crisis.

Thanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the """"back story"""" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).
Yeah, I thought maybe if people saw that, the GA note, they won't leave me a message. Though, that didn't work, as a user left me a message regarding an article I reviewed. This has to work in the future. I'm a have to make it better. I still haven't gotten the chance to see it, but I have to see it. I need to know what happened and stuff. Well, after I got the news that he lost, I started watching his DVD and telling myself that I'll never see his wrestling moves again. I didn't cry, I  was just sad. The night on Raw, I lost it and cried. Whatever, I didn't think that was cool. Shawn didn't mind, but I did. Not really, I still don't see that """"face"""" like quality to him. I think they'll play Randy out like Triple H, you know, good with the crowd, but still have him """"heel-ish"""". Maybe cause all the new people are heel and they need some faces... who knows. Speaking of Randy, today's his birthday, turned 30.

Hello, 

I ask you to excuse my words but somehow I need to make clear why every ethnicity claims the right for itself to come with the truth. You are a well educated person and I praise you and Inuit18, but it does not work when you keep on those Wikipedian vandals instead just ignoring them and asking an Admin to protect the article until the dispute is finished. By pay them attention you force yourself to a foul. Is it that worth? As I already wrote, I neither welcome nationalistic views and opinions from my own people nor from others which are only warm air. It´s our duty to nurture our children toward the truth otherwise we have to suffer in our misery we created ourself for our own. Created on the basis of lies and today people day on the basis of lies. That´s pure sacrifice of innocent children of Afghanistan who had nothing to do with those lies but they are the victims. Why?? I know many Pashtuns did great damages on non-Pashtuns and devided them by their varieties but in return many non-Pashtuns dominate them with their cultural- lingusitical superiority . Today, those who are responsible for killings and lootings are sitting on the streets or get killed. Many Pashtuns have lost everything and live under the right of existence. The Mohammadzai were known to be wealthy and very rich and giving Afghanistan it´s ruling class with it´s royals, but today they do not differ from Kuchis and the drug-infected people of Kabul or Hazaras of Behsud or Tajiks of Kandahar. The same things I am writing here I always tell to my own friends and relatives. Let´s stop these idiocy and work together. Our own hearty people will deal with our criminals and you need to do the same with yours. Those who devided Afghanistan were fascists or servants of foreigners. They have cost more than 50Mio. people. Think about it and I ask you again to excuse my harsh words.

Speedy deletion of Music Singularity
 A tag has been placed on Music Singularity requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for web content. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

[[:Genesis creation myth]] → Creation according to Genesis — The article was the most Stable under this name, Secondly if the first thing we have to say in the introduction is a defense of how """"it is neutral""""; than odds are it is not neutral.

'In this Discussion Please dont use Straw man Arguments, they insult both the User writing them and the Users Reading them'

* Support The article was the most Stable under this name, Secondly if the first thing we have to say in the introduction is a defense of how """"it is neutral""""; than odds are it is not neutral Current title seems to be a POV-push of how it is just myth; whether or not it is a myth or not in academia. It is unacetable to label something held as sacred to half the world (Jew+Christian+Muslim), This is not Censorship but common sense. The instability of This article since i think an acceptable middle ground would run something like

""""Creation according to Genesis refers to the text found in the opening two chapters of the book of Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew Bible. This text has been identified as a creation myth by scholars,[1] and has religious significance for Christians and Jews."""""""" (AFA Prof suggest two months ago)   
 OPPOSE """"Creation according to Genesis"""" implies reality, it is inaccurate and in disharmony with other articles about other creation myths. This article is not religious propaganda. We have already discussed this at great length and we will not have a small minority of editors force their ideology down everybody's throats.  .
 According to Genesis is just what it is. if people want to take Genesis and take it as literal fact that is their prerogative.   

''

 Cush, I think you're shying at shadows - does anyone think """"Creation according to the Rig Veda"""" would imply acceptance of the Vedas as history or fact?   
 Support - It's high time this POV-pushing sham of a title was put out of its misery and restored with something more sensible and less partisan. The current title was only chosen for the sake of its offensiveness value. I think the few editors who insisted on this title have already received all the mileage reward they're ever going to get, hope they enjoyed it.   

 OPPOSE Why does Christian-judeo religious belief deserve special treatment? The genesis creation myth clearly meets the definition on the Myth page of wikipedia as a """"sacred myth"""". We haven't gone around changing Greek Mythology to something like """"Heros and gods according to ancient Greeks"""". Christian Mythology refers to this as one of a body of myths.

Aaahhh ... the Wiki word of 'majick:' consensus. 'N then inspiring usages as: '... balanced discussions moving towards consensus.' With respect, KieferSkunk, you're indulging in some smoke with mirrors 'n handwaving. Since, whenever, has 'consensus' been some sort of guarantee of guidance towards ... what IS? (True/just ... etc. etc.) I'd bet that, on history's scale, 'consensus' is a miserable failure. The 'Triangle Trade' was a matter of 'community consensus' among those who participated, as was the Holocaust. But, anyway, that it is a comforting fiction of human understanding is neither here nor there. It's, well, what can I say, sooo subjective ... and thus by Wiki's own 'standards' unencyclopaedic. Grudging acceptance maybe ;-)

The idea of 'consensus' as being an aspect of 'mediocrity,' a kind of 'dumbing down' is featured in a recent R4 docu. on Wiki:

Yes, I had attempted to replace the Facebook like to the Sante Kimes article because it is an external link related to Sante Kimes, however, I have now read that Facebook pages are not allowed as external links. So I will no longer attempt to add it.

Also, if you could please help regarding the Sante Kimes article. Apparently, because I am a scholar of that case, along with many other court cases, I'm being perceived as a person attempting to alter the integrity of the information on that page.
I have read that a user that insists on updates to only a certain page(s) is frowned upon, but is it not valuable to have a person who has extensive knowledge of a subject help construct an accurate article on that subject?
In my opinion, the Kimes article is rather biased and one-sided as to all the facts and available sources about the case.
Several of the sources listed in the """"References section"""" have statements by Kimes that are apparently being ignored, in favor for statements by judges or third parties quoted in newspaper reports. Likewise, the sources named in the """"References section"""" is, in and of themselves, biased. One very important aspect to the Sante Kimes cases has been her consistent plea of innocence and current appeals, however, that point is virtually ignored on the Kimes article. 
I'm glad you mention the pillars, because from what I understand, Wikipedia wants to display a neutral point of view on article subjects. However, the Sante Kimes article has a biased point of view throughout it. Several of which I have noted on the discussion page for the Sante Kimes article. It appears to me that because of who she is, her Wikipedia article is being influenced by public opinion. If you have time, please read the Sante Kimes article, and let me know if you share my interpretation. Sorry for writing so much, but I'm just trying to explain my actions.

I usually read all of a discussion and think about it, before replying to any of it.

We have yet to have any sources that show that Brian Harvey is an expert, or what fields he is an expert in.  It's rare for an instructor at a University to be tenured, and also rare for senior faculty to let them make policy decisions alone, without tenured senior faculty's input and approval.  Instructors are usually hired to implement policy set by senior faculty, and kept on if they do the specified job well. This frees up faculty for other tasks and projects.  But this is mute - see the next point. (But if you feel you have to, in Brian Harvey's case, sources please to show otherwise.)   

Brian Harvey is not what Wikipedia refers to as an Independent Source (aka third party source).  He has used Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SCIP) at Berkeley and has been acknowledged by Abelson and Sussman in the Second Edition of SCIP. (He is not acknowledged in the First edition. (Took me a little while to find a hardcopy.)) So using him as a reference is a small step from using Hal Abelson, the subject of this biography. Wikipedia asks that non-Independent Sources be used with care and only when an Independent Source can not be found. 
 
The Boston Globe reference has the same issue in their feature, and should not be used as we have an Independent Source.   

Chris Haynes and Dan Friedman are acknowledged in the Second Edition of SCIP.  Mitch Wand is acknowledged in the First Edition of SCIP.  So their book has the non-Independent Source problem.   

Which leaves us one source that  found. I'm not going to try and find out if it's an Independent Source, i.e. who was in the group that decided on giving Abelson the award.   

Without a reference, this sentence with the word """"worldwide"""" in it fails WP:NPOV. It is also unclear what it means: how many CS departments?, what parts of the world?, etc. Even with a reference, the claim should be in a quote from that reference, not in plain text. Wikipedia prose is suppose to be written in a neutral tone, with non-neutral text clearly tied to a source. WP:NPOV also requires that available WP:SOURCES (if any) that balance out the article on this and other parts of the text be added. If you know of one on this point or others, please add it to this biography.   

A claim this wide could have other Independent Sources making it.  If any one wants to find and add them ...   

The laundry list of course materials is trivia that isn't needed in a biography, and is distracting to the reader.   

So ....   

Proposed consensus

I propose we change the sentence to this:

The Association for Computing Machinery notes this course """"was widely emulated and adopted by colleges around the world.""""

and add this as a new paragraph, perhaps in a new section Awards:In 2011, Abelson received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  The citation read """"For his contribution to computing education, through his innovative advances in curricula designed for students pursuing different kinds of computing expertise, and for his leadership in the movement for open educational resources.''

If this award was published in an ACM journal, it be better to use the  template.

The Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award has neither an article nor a template. It's in over a dozen articles so far. Create either if you feel it's meets WP:N.

I move to strike  from the Lead.   

I also move to strike the entire last paragraph of the lead {{Genealogical researchers have documented that ancestors of many Lumbee families were part of a tri-racial isolate group of predominantly African and European ethnicity, originating among individuals free in colonial Virginia. Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under """"other free"""".[3]}}

WRT """"innocent""""  this is not a """"verified fact"""".  
 Does the Chinese government agree they are """"innocent""""?  No.
 The DoJ appealed Urbina's ruling on Razakah's habeas.  Did they think he is """"innocent""""?
 Urbina wasn't ruling on Razakah's """"innocence"""".  None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were """"innocent"""" of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the """"preponderance of the evidence"""" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.

The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were """"innocent"""".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, """"enemy combatants"""".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were """"enemy combatants"""".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.

Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's """"innocence"""" has been an established fact.
As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina.
If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, """"...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah..."""", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase """"wrongfully imprisoned"""" in other habeas rulings.

WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.

WRT his """"innocence"""", you assert above: """"There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established """"early"""".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The time, as it seemed to me, did come and we went into the fight. I am glad that we did, we seem to have lost, we have not lost. To refuse to fight would have been to lose, to fight is to win, we have kept faith with the past, and handed a tradition to the future… I assume I am speaking to Englishmen who value their own freedom, and who profess to be fighting for the freedom of Belgium and Serbia. Believe that we too love freedom and desire it. To us it is more desirable than anything else in the world. If you strike us down now we shall rise again and renew the fight.

Gwen I am sorry that you refuse to provide accountability for the actions you undertook as an Admin.  Accountability is simply providing the basis for which you are creating a block to an editor. 
Since you seem determined to obfuscate and side step in every possible way, instead of simply giving reasons of what I did to merit getting blocked, it does seem that my asking for your cooperation here has run its course.

While I agree that this article isn't FA material, I must suggest that your added criticism in the lead is also repetitive.  The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, """"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan."""")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.

There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.  Right or wrong, to have it read as though this radio program frequently interviews current members of the """"Ku Klux Klan"""" is misleading.

 A Short History of Progress edits 

Hi there Maclean, I will try to keep this short. I noticed your rewrite and you did some good work (and a lot it too) and thanks for that: plenty of review references also. 
Although I actually prefer the original but this is probably a matter of style and preference.
The good side is that now the original is defunct and no longer published at Wikipedia I can effectively take it back at least by fact although I know not really by law.  I am going to move on from Wikipedia into my own blog...
Things have a habit of getting dumbed down here particularly into mediocre and ineloquent English.
It is a bit cookbookish now: section by section of the Author's book...
Also I don't actually like the Background paragraph style as this should go into the Author Bio page otherwise you would have repeat it for ever Article for every book by that Author!?
Hence the downside of a cookbook or templated approach. 
Question: are foootnoted references to say comparison with other Authors considered original Research?
Also I couldnt find your original ref online but Martin Scoresse does not appear on Cinemaginaire's page for the film as an executive producer - given his preemminence I would pretty much take this as indicating that he is no longer associated with the project?
Also although you keenly summarized/precis some of the quotes (particular the first intro one) there were a few bits (perhaps cut down) I would still like to see in the article particularly from his concluding remarks """"an ice age hunter gather, clever but seldom wise"""" etc and the last Easter islander bit as they are muost poignant and expressive rendered thus in the authors own words than in a cookbook summary of the book.  (I had this same difficulty once summarizing Nietzsche for an essay and in the end largely used the authors own words: how can one after all precis Nietzsche!)
Please don't be offended.  Maybe we should collaborate a little as I have no doubt that we will get a better result than either of us would otherwise on our own. 
Respond here or at my User Mattjs discussion page. (I rarely log in any more but will do so to check.) I will check back here in a few weeks or so (maybe longer) and make a few changes above after your feedback.

 It's really rather sad 

That I can ask an otherwise legitimate question on a talk page like this, but because one person does not like the way I phrased it, it is suddenly """"vandalism"""" and deleted completely.  If anything, you could say I was rude in the way I asked my question, but as far as I can tell, vandalism = intentionally disruptive edits, and, more importantly, edits to actual articles.  These talk pages are intended to talk, are they not?  The standards of writing something in an encyclopedic manner do not apply here.

At least from my understanding.

But even if they do, assuming that my post was solely created as a vandalism, when I was asking an otherwise legitimate question, is completely unnecessary.  Or are those policies such as """"WP:Assume Good Faith"""" or whatever all for show after all?  Seems very seldom that people actually do assume good faith around here.  They're just as happy to tag anything they don't like as vandalism, even more so if the person posting it isn't a regular.

I dunno, just a few observations.  I'll admit that I don't edit here often, so if I've somehow missed something that somehow changes the situation completely, feel free to let me know.

Bradford City Hall
Hi.  Thanks for your question.  I'm ashamed to say I've never been to Bradford City Hall, even though I wrote the article on it.  I'd love to go.  I did speak to a local journo who said that it was OK to take photos in there, though.  (Some town halls are a bit weird about photos; no-one has told them about panoramafreiheit.)  Anyway, what I could do for you is to phone Bradford Council tomorrow and if I'm lucky I'll get some bored employee who would just love to leave their desk and look at the windows.  People never look at anything, and you can bet your life someone is working beneath your window day in, day out, and hasn't noticed it.  If I forget, keep reminding me until I do it.  It would be a fun job to go and photograph it.  I need to do a winter photo of Bradford Industrial Museum, anyway - you can't see the jolly thing for trees in summer.  
 Update: I rang Bradford City Hall, and they had not heard of any such memorial window.  Someone kindly investigated for me, and they rang back today and said that it's a mistake, and there is no architectural feature such as a memorial window dedicated to this lady.  There is a movable installation within the building, incorporating a display dedicated to her and to other local heroes.  I'm told that this is in a public place and that I can visit it.  I shall photograph that for you when I can - hopefully during the next couple of weeks - but I'm sorry there is no window to photograph. I guess that there is a slight possibility that there may be a memorial window in a church somewhere, and that could explain the error, but I don't know how to investigate that.  
 Thanks for your reply.  I've just heard that I may be able to visit the City Hall tomorrow.  I'll see what I can do.  
 Update: Just letting you know that because Coronation Street is filming in the building for the next two weeks, it will not be permissible for me to get into the building to see the display which includes B.J. Harrison. The staff have tried to fix it for me today, but cannot.  I'll try to do it in two or three weeks' time, though.  If I appear to be delaying or forgetting, please kindly give me a reminder.  Thanks.

 Tudeley and treacle 

Hi there.

The problem with the treacle mine entry is that although it is amusing it does not add much to the general content of the page.

If you were to expand the Tudeley article to include a lot more information about the place, and then add your (quite amusing) treacle mine ref for good measure I would have no problem.

But when the article is just 120-odd words in length, to devote 10% of them to treacle mines seems disproportionate to me.

Hiya,

No, I didn't..what a time to be on holiday and not see the 'frickin' article on BBC!  Thankfully they've posted the piece on the web.  As far as I know, they think, with some justification, that it's a D017, but there doesn't appear to be a definite identification of it being THE D017 in my article, although the circumstantial evidence seems strong. Being local, I'm hoping to talk to the guys featured and see if I can find out some specifics. I'll pass on what I can but as this would constitute original research, I guess I can only point interested readers to other external content like the BBC Kent page -( Bummer!

 Request for opinion 

An opinion was requested here I now offer one. The tone of this article prose-ridden and in-universe. Assume that a person reading this has no idea what a Jak is, and has never heard about previous Jak games or the Jak universe. Look at each part and ask yourself if it is 100% clear that this particular section is about a fictional game that exists in relation to other games (not just in the intro). Remember that you are describing a work of fiction, not telling a story. Also the style is repetitive and boring. Let me pick apart a paragraph - 

The missions (what is meant by """"mission""""?) in Jak 3 are generally either platform-based(platforming) or driving-based. The platform segments involve Jak(""""the player"""", Jak is a rendered model, someone else is doing the jumping. """"Jak"""" is ok for story elements, but gameplay is about the player) jumping from platform to platform (that is what platforming means, right?) battling creatures along the way (he battles in both types of missions, right?). For these segments, he is also provided a rifle (does someone give him a rifle at the beginning of each segment?), the functionality of which changes with the kind of ammunition being used (how so?, also maybe """"changes depending on the ammunition used""""). The car driving (""""driving"""", """"car"""" is implied) segments (segmentsX2) usually involve Jak racing against time (prose, try """"have specific time constraints"""") to complete a mission (that is what one does with missions), while defending himself against other cars (cars attack people?) or giant Metal Heads (?). When not on a mission (missionX3), Jak wanders the streets of either Spargus or Haven City (prose, and what reason do we have to care which fictional city he is wandering in?), searching for someone to assign him a mission (this sentence makes him sound so lame).

I'd do an edit myself, but I know nothing of Jak, and as it is this article does not make me care to. ~  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Definitions of Beat vs. No such thing as a """"Beat"""" artist, Round 2: The Formal Argument Edition! 

Now let's get down to some actual business. Formal argument is necessary because this argument has degenerated so far (by me, mostly, just for fun). I'll break it down piece by piece so it's easier to digest for people unwilling to read what others are saying:

Purpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term """"Beat Generation"""" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who """"is"""" and """"isn't"""" a """"beat.""""

Proposal: We should fix the structure of the page 

Ginsberg Deliberate Prose:
""""The phrase 'beat generation' rose out of a specific conversation with Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes around '50-51 when, discussing the nature of generations recollecting the glamour of the lost generation, Kerouac said, Ah, this is nothing but a beat generation ... not meaning to name the generation but to un-name it.""""

He discusses the origin of the term """"beat"""" in """"hip language"""" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with """"beatific"""" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom's side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says """"articulated"""" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).

""""A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the 'beat generation literary movement.' This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in '48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.

""""By the mid-fifties this smaller circle, through natural affinity of modes of thought or literary style or planetary perspective was augmented in friendship and literary endeavor by a number of writers in San Francisco, including Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and a number of other powerful but lesser-known poets such as Jack Micheline, Ray Bremser, and ... LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.

""""By the mid-fifties a sense of some mutual trust and interest was developed with Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch, as well as with Robert Creeley and other alumni of Black Mountain ...

Welcome

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are a few good links for newcomers:

 The five pillars of Wikipedia
 How to edit a page
 Help pages
 Tutorial
 How to write a great article
 Manual of Style

Here are some other hints and tips:

 I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many benefits of having a username.  (If you edit without a username, your IP address is used to identify you instead.)
 When using talk pages, please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Questions, ask me on , or type  {{helpme}}  on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will answer your questions as far as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian. '' """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't want to go about beating around a dead Bantha, but after reviewing the sequence of the transformation on DVD I discovered something interesting when viewing the scene in slow motion within chronological order. In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-ups on a conflicted Anakin, the camera focuses back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. If the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the """"true Sidious"""" drip a bit more menace. That's all well and good, but there must be a within-universe explanation for it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose –10 Lose –9 Lose –33Win +5  Win +7  Lose –24 Lose –2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. –5  –9  +31

So in this example, Team C would win the tie breaker with +31, Team A will be second
with -5, and Team B will be last with -9.

The effect of gravitational frequency shift on the GPS system due to general relativity is that a clock closer to a massive object will be slower than a clock farther away. Applied to the GPS system, the receivers are much closer to Earth than the satellites, causing the GPS clocks to be faster by a factor of 5×10^(-10), or about 45.9 μs/day. This gravitational frequency shift is also a noticeable effect.

There is a mistake. Yes, it is true, that the clock father away will be faster due to the weaker gravitional field. However, in case of orbiting satellites the effective gravitational field is completely canceled by the acceleration (remember totaly weightless astronauts in the orbit). According of the postulate of the general relativity theory an steady acceleration is equivalent to a homogenuos gravitational field - the satellite is in the effective zero-field.
Thus, the factor 45.9 μs/day must correspond to zero-field time dilatation, not somewhat-weaker-field time dilatation.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks. 

...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies. 

It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.  

Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.

The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.  

The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. 

Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.

The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.

At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.

Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf, it could get its way...

 Recent edits by dapi 

User dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias

the infobox

some weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check
fast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios
. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.

what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke
, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take
this number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz
really uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this """"trick"""" with tanks:

the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find
1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz """"numbers"""" but now it comes, he totally forgot 
the steppefront
with 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm
. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this
troops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded
~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 
5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.
so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?

while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about 
the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers 
came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).
this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all
the german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with
sources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every
reader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....

dapi comments his changes with """"removing unreliable ed"""" []
he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even
krivosheev becomes """"dubios"""" for user dapi [].
while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his fact
that red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 losses
for the complete """"zitadellecampaign"""" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-
page. so his opinions is not straight...

 Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.
 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I would hope that between that editing and the additional citations the editors will see their way to removing some of the tags.

I shan't revert further on the article, as I don't want to be seen as not assuming good faith, and I don't want to edit war over a topic that is only of passing interest to me =) But I am of the opinion that a good deal of the speculation and hearsay in the article is in violation of BLP.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot.

My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

 Epiwafer 

I am surprised to learn that """"epiwafer"""" was a popular term right around 2000-2002, the exact time that my company started to use epi wafers.  I should pay more attention to ads, I guess.  Anyway, it quickly settled back to more normal terminology, like """"epitaxial wafer"""", looks like.  I guess another move is in order.    

Hi , I think it best to look at all those Google searches on the Talk page, and see which spelling/nomenclature  adding the web + book, singular + plural spellings (that's four searches for each spelling)  has the most hits, for the title of the article. If you want, I can do that and add them up. Of course, the company name will skew """"epiwafer"""" so we can exclude that if you like.   
We don't use plurals, and book searches are generally more authoritative than web searches, but feel free to provide more data.    
Plurals are for the Google searches, because obviously many of the mentions (even in books) are only in plural, not singular, so an exact-phrase Google search (i.e., in quotation marks) will omit those mentions unless a plural form is searched. I'm fine with the fully spelled-out version as long as all of the other spellings redirect to it; therefore should probably also create a redirect for Epi-wafer, since that hyphenated form is sometimes used as well.

If you want to read more about the eccentricities of American dress (at-least the conservative / preppy kind) I'd recommend flipping through The Preppy Handbook by Lisa Birnbach, originally written as quite tounge-in-cheek, it has been taken seriously partially because although a parody, it's quite true i most respects.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Either way, my response is that positive relationships can create bias or the appearance of bias, which appears to be one of the many issues this talk section touches on.  My two cents.  Deletion of other's posts when they are not vandalism is not conducive to good editing or atmosphere, I suggest.  Especially when the deletions are done so quickly and the argument to which they refer remains up.

You insist on saying that if this is a problem then this must be because there are different opinions about specific facts and sources, but this is not the case at all. Causteau's own explanations to you above make his attitude clear, which is that he'll revert anything he can find a reason to revert and he finds people making lots of edits somehow against Wikipedia policy. If necessary, he'll keep looking for new reasons he can experiment with after others are knocked down, and he is willing to revert before he has his argument together as well, on the basis that people should not be edited until he has had his satisfaction.

In response to User Hoary's topic The term """"Ebonics"""" and the appearance of a legal threat

Ernie Smith writes

I maintain that those who view and use the word Ebonics as being a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, are either totally ignorant of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics or they are fully aware of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics and elect to use word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive. Since by definition to counterfeit is to: “try to deceive by pretense or dissembling.” the propagation of a false definition of the word ‘Ebonics’ as being a synonym for BE, AAVE other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive, is larcenous counterfeiting. Given that by definition """"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own"""" and using a """"created production without crediting the source"""" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.

Here's my five cents: I do not think it is practical to give coords for a middle point of Routes. I have looked around a bit and the only place I happened to find such coords is in Bundesautobahn 2. In this example there is an important junction in a city near the centre, so it makes sense, but in some Routes like Route 10 which consist of 3 or more separate fragments, defining any """"central"""" point on them is too arbitrary. Also some routes are important and wide for a part of their length only, so their """"middle"""" is not anything to go by. I would be happy with 2 points, but I know this is not practical in searching. I think an important destination (city or big town) somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 of their length should be picked. But cases like Route 10 need more coords, maybe inline.  Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Origins
The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009. (See also: Talk:List_of_Charmed_episodes#Article_split_into_subpages and the following section of Talk:List of Charmed episodes) Subsequent systematic improvements to the inadequate alledged synopses of that page gradually showed by late in the month, the page needed split. Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.
These subpages are named to form the series links:

Paris RER

Ehm, some comments about your Gare Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 RER edits: it's not a good idea to create a new article when there is already an article about the same subject. The naming convention for RER stations is """"X (Paris RER)"""", except when the station is also used by regular trains (Transilien, TER or other), then we use """"Gare de X"""". I just saw that you moved nearly all of the RER stations. Better discuss it before you introduce a new standard name. 

If you're sure that no trains from Charles de Gaulle take the branch line to Robinson, you can change the """"type2"""" field into """"B4"""" instead of """"both"""". But I checked it on the RATP website, and they do. I don't think it's very useful to show all the different options for the RER lines, some trains skip a few stations, or serve only part of the line.

Lawrence Wilkerson in a recent interview with the The Real News Network states: """"Dostum is now running the huge... they're not just passing the raw opium product anymore - Dostum is now running a huge state-of-the art factory inside Afghanistan which is producing the heroin."""" I suggest this should be included in this article. Perhaps corroborated with other sources.

Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WP:DBAD (here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit -) ), as I consider you had pointed me (  ;-)  ), but that still hasn't given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page (here I mean the Talk:International recognition of Kosovo page). As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the """"procedure"""", because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): """"Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of."""" concerning the closure of """"proposal"""". I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (""""IroK"""") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.
Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the """"IroK"""" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term """"recognition"""" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.

Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish """"Cross""""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is """"Jewish"""". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not """"ethnically"""" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is """"Black"""" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is """"Jewish"""" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had """"Jewish mother"""". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her """"Jewish"""", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't """"ethnically"""" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under """"some guy's website"""". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.

Most of the articles I have seen state that manipulation (which is only one part of chiropractic) is at least as effective and most conclude that manipulation used with a multimodal approach such as with exercise therapy has a synergistic effect and is by far safer than OTC meds, NSAID's and prescription medications in the long term.  Think about it, less than 30 deaths after billions of treatments over 100 years is surely considered extremely safe.  I contacted the American Chriopractic Association.  They stated that they have already tried to provide information about scope of practice to Wikipedia but they are having troubles with posting to the page also.  If there is ever a source that should be considered respectable to Wikipedia, it should be the American Chiropractic Association (the chiropractic equivalent to the American Medical Association).  Please let me know what I need to do to get the more positive and consistent research to post to this page.  I am a little suprised at how difficult this is.  I have peer reviewed medical research and the American Chiropractic Association trying to provide proof that the information I presented was accurate.  I am not sure what else I can do.  Please forgive my ignorance.  I am new to this site and I am still learning the rules.

I edited out the Trivia section (which read: """"The Explosions in the Sky song 'Have You Passed Through This Night?' from the album Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Die... has been remixed by the British breakbeat outfit UNKLE, and is featured on the James Lavelle Romania album."""")  For several reasons.  

1. The song """"Have You Passed Through This Night"""" was not remixed by UNKLE.  Rather the song """"Eye 4 An Eye"""" features samples from the same speach in The Thin Red Line (see songwriting credits 1,2) 

2.There is no 'Romania' album.

Conflict of Interest

A Wikipedia conflict of interest (COI) is an incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. COI editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. 

COI edits are strongly discouraged. When they cause disruption to the encyclopedia in the opinion of an uninvolved administrator, they may lead to accounts being blocked and embarrassment for the individuals and groups who were being promoted.Editing in the interests of public relations is particularly frowned upon. This includes, but is not limited to, edits made by public relations departments of corporations; or of other public or private for-profit or not-for-profit organizations; or by professional editors paid to edit a Wikipedia article with the sole intent of improving that organization's image. Merely participating in or having professional expertise in a subject is not, by itself, a conflict of interest.

Editors who may have a conflict of interest are not barred from participating in articles and discussion of articles where they have a conflict of interest, but must be careful when editing in mainspace.  Compliance with this guideline requires discussion of proposed edits on talk pages and avoiding controversial edits in mainspace.
 
A noticeboard for reporting and discussing incidents that require intervention related to the application of this guideline is available at Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard.  The noticeboard is for reporting and discussing the application of the conflict of interest guideline to incidents and situations where editors may have close personal or business connections with article topics.  The noticeboard is not for reporting the mere existence of conflicts of interest nor for the fact of compliance with the COI guideline through talk-page discussion.

What is a conflict of interest?

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a forum for advertising or self-promotion, or a vanity press. As such, it should contain only material that complies with its content policies, and Wikipedians must place the interests of the encyclopedia first. Any editor who gives priority to outside interests may be subject to a conflict of interest.

There are no firm criteria to determine whether a conflict of interest exists, but there are warning signs. Adding material that appears to promote the interests or visibility of an article's author, his family members, employer, associates, or h",0,0,0,0,0,0

 2012 in UFC events 

When the situation calms down (or even before then if you want), would you be willing to do a peer review of 2012 in UFC events?  You aren't heavily involved in MMA articles and have only gotten involved though AfDs of various articles.  If this concept is going to be continued to full year articles (2012 in mixed martial arts) and for past years, I'd be interested in hearing from a somewhat uninvolved person how the articles could be further improved on.    
I will do what I can.  I have commented in a few places with the goal of opening a few minds, but there are many who simply hate change, so it will take some time and patience.  I don't have an exact picture in my head of how it should be done, but I do think you and Mtking are moving the right direction, in spite of a lot of close minded opposition.    
Hey Dennis, you like the rule book right? Well, here you go! WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY
WP:IGNORE   
What you are doing it cherry picking sentences that fit your desires, not understanding the policies as a whole.  I can't fix that, only you can.    

 Excellently written 

This is excellently written, much better than I could have done. If people will listen is another story, but let's not go there. I personally would have linked moved forward without you to WP:5THWHEEL , but that might be a little harsh (or not). Well done. (bainuu)  
I've posted in a few places, a bit of a velvet hammer, if you will.  I don't contribute content to MMA, and I'm hoping that that some people will listen simply because I'm objective, an old timer here and not an admin.  Most won't, but change will be easier if we can change the momentum from negative, to contributory, of a few people at a timer.    
I think it is what was needed, that and your follow up. I'm not an MMA person myself (not since I watched UFC 1 on an illegal PPV box shhhhh). Everyone finds change difficult, on and off wiki, I think you've done a great service with your comments, heeded or not. (bainuu)

Alright I did some work on it. How's the page looking so far? Any suggestions?   
I'm no expert, but it seems to be shaping up nicely.  Keep in mind that it may change in format several times before it is all said and done, so don't get too attached to any one way of doing things.  Just keep a cool head and talk about it on the talk page.  Sometimes several ways are tried, and they end up going back to the first way.  It is all part of the process.  As you may or may not have noticed, I don't actually contribute to the content on the articles anyway, my function here is mainly to help the transition go more smoothly and help people understand the reasons for the changes.  You know 100x more about MMA than I will ever know, so there isn't much I can do to help you with the actual content.  Your positive attitude toward the changes is very much appreciated.

 Fullmetal Particle Man 

Another Youtube video (located here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahNYobJ_gjQ ) that I noticed that ALSO happens to fit extremely well features Fullmetal Alchemist characters in the positions of the four men;

Edward Elric (aka Ed, aka the Fullmetal Alchemist) is cast as Particle Man, this being the most obvious joke/reference; he's extremely touchy about his height, him being almost/most likely the shortest man in the military and NEARLY the shortest main character  I think that his brother Alphonse's real body takes that distinguishment away, however). In his sequence of the Youtube video, the lines are accompanied by rather apt sequences from the anime (among them, the line """"When he's underwater does he get wet, | Or does the water get him instead?"""" is accompanied by a clip of Ed sinking to the bottom of a body of water because of his prosthetic limbs  which happen to be made entirely of metal, hence his title the 'Fullmetal' Alchemist).

Colonel Roy Mustang (aka the Flame Alchemist) is cast as Triangle Man. Promoted at one point to Brigadier General and later became Fuhrer (sp?), he is constantly taking jabs at Edward (for a rather popular example, he more than occasionally jokes about Ed's height), though in one episode in the anime and a sidestory in the manga the two actually hold a battle on the parade grounds (with the Fuhrer's permission)  Mustang wins by a comeback landslide in the manga, but in the anime the then-Colonel hesitates (possibly due to post-traumatic stress disorder, as surmised due to a flashback being shown at that moment in the anime of a young man he had to kill in the Ishbal War) and thus loses to Ed; it is from the anime episode that the video actually gets the majority of its Particle Man VS Triangle Man footage.

Major Alex Louis Armstrong () is cast as Universe Man; all State Alchemists (such as, as noted before, Armstrong and Edward) carry watches, and in both manga and anime the man proudly brandishes his watch (supplying one shot used in the video if I recall), plus he is, despite his sheer size (he is easily tied with the husband of Izumi Curtis (sp?) as the tallest supporting character in the series) and power (he performs his particular brand of alchemy through the use of powerful punches  one scene in the anime has him pick up a slab of concrete with one hand, toss it in the air, and punch it, thus turning it into a massive bullet propelled at high speed via the punch's force). In the video, his power and compassion are both seen . . . along with his penchant for posing (most likely a trait passed down the Armstrong family line for generations  a lot of his many talents, from his alchemy to his skill at portraiture, seem to be this way).

Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc is cast as Person Man, and aptly so; out of all his co-workers, he seems to suffer the most problems, particularly in his love life  Mustang has effectively stolen every single girl he's dated in either series, anime or manga, with one exception (manga-only) being the homunculus Lust (going under the alias Solaris; admittedly, it was a poor choice, as she later was proved to have been using him and ended up wounding him in his leg to the point that he could not be of any use in the military, hence his subsequent resignation, plus the Flame Alchemist did in fact kill Lust during the same incident where she crippled Havoc). Hence, the line """"Triangle Man hates Person Man"""" is given even more meaning with this Youtube video. (Ironically, when the line """"Lives his life in a garbage can"""" comes up, it shows Roy Mustang's old residence back when he was obsessed with, if I remember correctly, human transmutation.)

Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.

First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)
Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  """"No-boo"""" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.
If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called """"The No-boo Affair"""", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is """"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did"""", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a """"clear falsification"""", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term """"no-boo"""" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.
Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J.

"""" Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a Pennsylvania anti-federalist """"minority report"""" published after the state's constitutional convention: [followed by selected quotation from the """"minority report""""]

 Early Republic; 2nd paragraph 
Right,
For the 2nd paragraph, the why (for what needs to be done), and how (suggestions) -
1st, the why:

besides the 1) excessive number of bibliographical citations in Portuguese, which I claim to be unneeded, since there is abundant literature in English dealing with the subject;
My suggestion is that (keeping the paragraph short, btw depending on the option to be chosen, even shorter), must be also fixed:

2) the truncation of the narrative, referring to fix the correlational gaps of
2.1 the beginning of the republic and the military rebellions of the 1920s, and to
2.2 the mentions about all revolts of the 1930s, and not just the communist one, 
Or 
- 2.2.1 - to maintain coherence, don' mention any (1930s) revolt specifically , in the manner suggested below

3) (Regarding the briefness of the paragraph); remove the excess of detail inferred from a source in Portuguese. Details that can be contained in other more specific articles of Wikipedia, related to the history of that period
I refer specifically to this passage  """"The repression of the opposition was brutal with more than 20,000 people imprisoned, internment camps created for political prisoners in distant regions of the country, widespread torture by the government agents of repression, and censorship of the press.**"""" ; 
which can be summarized as suggested (see suggestion about Point 3) below 

My suggestions for How -
Regarding to: 
Point 1, use the abundant literature in English dealing with the subject, as some which I used

Point 2.1, a variation of what I had proposed:
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, through various civilian and military rebellions, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 
Or, shorter 
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 

Points 2.2, 2.2.1 and 3 (bold letters)
 """"Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Thus (following the justifications above), one possibility of how the entire paragraph could be:

 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt. Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Note that, besides Not contain the defects stated above, even With the phrase  """"in the wake of the murder of his running mate, """" - this possible version is by far a shorter paragraph than the present version.

You contrive artificial difference between information and knowledge and then use it to argue that relating biological sharing is obscuring in this context. That is obscuration. Categorical declaration of synonyms mean different things is obscuration. Saying """"it is obscuring at best"""" implies the worse thing, vandalism at worst. The """"culture"""" means that we evolve something by sharing ideas/information/solutions/knowledge/good features. Same happens in the biology. That is what I am saying. Sexual recombination (of best parents) in biology = simple communication in our knowledge sphere. We, human, have got the neural network and speech  another evolutionary mechanism, which can evolve (improve the culture) separately from biology (the genes).

6e3ba6a784b49f56,"Plummer published in 1896. Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine. Given Plummer's age, I don't think a mention in Laurence's article about Plummer's belief is that pertient, although I am pretty sure it'll make its way into the Bede series of articles. On the canon law bit, I think the bit I've mentioned is enough to establish that it was irregular, but that opinions are divided. (Gotta love those Victorian scholars who just KNEW what was right (grins)). I guess my main problem with Plummer is that he's over a hundred years old. More modern scholars seem to think that reliance on canon law wasn't as important to the papacy and the chuech at this point in time. For Laurence the important points are that he was consecrated by his predecessor and that some folks may have felt this was irregular.

I agree to some of your claims and appreciate your suggestions but I would like to point out that you have removed literally all statistics and some of them are clearly appropriate. I've deliberately put life expectancy """"in comparison to other advanced economies"""" to make it clear - the comparisons give a clear indication of the progress S Korea has made and is not a POV. You can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles, such as that one in Portugal. In other words, some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed. As I say, you reverted all of my edits, so I did agree with some of your edits, which I left out or reworded in an appropriate manner. I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as """"due to its healthy manufacturing base"""", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison.

In the same way, an embryo's potential for personhood does not constitute personhood, and potential rights are not actual rights, so nobody is choosing life or death for a person.  When a woman chooses not to become a mother, it is the pregnancy that is aborted, not a person.  The actual rights of an actual person are being recognized as primary over the potential rights of a potential person.
Of course, if you're really against abortion, like I am, not just choice, the real solution here is to allow comprehensive sexual education and full, free access to contraception.  Women who don't have an unwanted pregnancy are never in the position to even consider an abortion.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wow, I honestly don't know where to begin to respond to that ~ so lets start with your """"talking points."""" First off, I'm not trying to Americanize the article, somethings were changed (like donburi to rice bowl) but they are largely a manual of style issue than anything else. Next off, I'm not egotistical so showing off my editing skills is a non-issue, plus this is Wikipedia, someone else editing your work is a fact of life. Third, Deja Vu Artworks is based in Japan, if I worked for them that would seem that I lived in Japan as well, in which case, why would I want to Americanize the article?  Which brings us to trying to improve the article. As noted before, a good chuck of infomraiton in the original revisions was irrelevant - you do NOT need a song listing from a flash animation in an article that is a general overview of a subject. Also, the Deja Vu information was removed because it was unsourced and I can't seem to find any indication of resolution for the topic - it happened in 2004 and it is now 2007 either it was resolved or it fell by the way side, where as the Netrunner controversy is still on going and received a great deal of notice when it happened. If there is a bunch of information on Deja Vu that I am missing then by all means, point out some links and we can work it into the article. Now, in regards to most of the changes - this article toes very close to the fancruft category and as such most of the edits are there to try and pull it away from that category. In case you haven't noticed, most of the information in the List of OS-tans article is gone because that article was deleted; one of the reasons for which was fancruft. Now all that said, there is no reason why the descriptions of the top five 'tans can be expanded a bit, but you must remember that should not be a full bio of the characters, plus the fact that they can be changed at an artists whim means that you can't write in the matter of """"OSX-tan is always seen poking XP-tan"""" with a stick - that is just one thing that an artist can do.

The way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as HelixQ is a joke.

Let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 Prime Spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so USENET was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.

Now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. Let's see wiki has a page on Dr. Bernstein, a guy that took the NSA to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.

You expect NSA funded journals like AMS to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?

Anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the NSA has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the Snowden documents.

So the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by GitHub, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of Eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that I KNOW has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the NSA since almost any reference to the many posts about ENNISA Prime Formula has been erased from Usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.

That all being said, I'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? Mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the NSA?

Prove wiki has no NSA bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly. 

The original article was what I would think any real mod not working for the NSA would agree was pretty NPOV, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.

The original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the PTB want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.

Anyone can google NSA and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching NSA and AMS, oh it's funded by the NSA. LOL

That's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. The PyPrimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.

Then the public can decide who discovered it, I know the origin is 1995 and 1997, I've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60Mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.

Then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but NSA funded projects.

What you don't think the NSA had laws in place for decades banning such work? They did. And now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, PRIME NUMBER THEORY.

The mere fact that a project that is open to PUBLIC SCRUTINY by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely NSA/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the PyPrimes speed tests like they are insignificant.

The fact is PyPrimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.

The fact is PyPrimes referred to the 1995 30Mod Prime algorithm as 'Croft Spirals', which is a joke since Croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 PyPrimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.

if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.  16:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Sorry to disagree again, but the article in question clearly puts the story forth as what each side says. (Narconon says drugs can be sweated out, doctors say no, etc.) How Dr. Touretzky took the story is not actually relevant, more on that at the end.
There are four basic """"sides"""" depicted in it, on one side Narconon and Scientology on the opposite Science and Ex-members/critics. The stuff on Touretzky's site is supported by the latter, and disputed by the former. To a neutral observer, like the Chronicle, it's a subject of controversy. (That's what ChrisO was saying.)
To explain why Dr. Touretzky's opinion of the story is irrelevant, I'll compare it to a reverse hypothetical situation; lets say Narconon felt that they had been quoted out of context. Both arguments are equally invalid since a paper isn't expected to publish what the subject wants published. (Actually, it's really similar to the lawsuit Barbara Schwarz filed against the Salt Lake City Tribune when they published her story and interview.)  

 On POV expressed in this and related articles on Wikipedia 

Incidentally, this article is an excellent example of the best case scenario of POV in a CoS/Hubbard article. It presents both sides arguments without additional comment by the paper, but unlike the Narconon/CoS claims, proof exists to back the assertions made by science. For example *Narco/tology's belief that all drugs have long longevity in fat, scrambling of 3D pictures, etc. compared to tests on human fat showing otherwise and the 3D picture theory to be unproven.
*Narconon and Scientology are for the purposes of the US Government separate entities and this abbreviation is not meant to imply otherwise. They do however share similar vocabulary and ideas, and when describing these I have chosen to abbreviate.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is indeed necessary to define free will and it is easy. I think it is a big mistake to announce that """"This article covers the non-theological aspects of free will"""" as the root of the concept is at least partly theological. 
Immediately recall that the very point of free will is to jusitify moral responsibility (historically, despite the fact that a perfect and omniscient god created man).
Then warn the reader that a perrenial source of confusion has been about the (apparent) randomness or non-determination in human choices and that this point will be adressed seperately because both """"aspects"""" of free will are (apparently) at odds.
Then, maybe after some historical notes introduce compatibilits' (at least Hume-like) free will  the ability to choose in agreement to one's principles (or main goals). The point of this definition is to found moral responsibility (ability to include the threat of punishment into one's decision process).
Once this definition has been given the rest of the issues are much clearer and especially the fact the some limited (macroscopic) determinism is required to give sense to it. 14:09, 3 October""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you saying that I originated a subject that then became a major research topic? (Unruh probably gets that credit, IMO). 
If you really care so deeply about Wiki then why do you either not have an account, or choose not to use it? This last post wasn't signed at all, which is against policy. What about the rule about not getting personal, Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks? Do you feel that you are exempt? You may feel that a personal characterisation of someone is justified in this case, but people wanting to make personal attacks are going to tend to believe that theirs is a special case, no matter how bad others feel their behaviour is. The Wiki official policy on this, states in large bold letters: """"There is no excuse for personal attacks on other contributors. Do not make them.""""

 There is also a Wiki guideline that says that posting another person's personal information (e.g. legal name) almost always counts as Wikipedia:Harassment, an intimidatory behaviour that encourages an unpleasant atmosphere, and may deter other from posting or contributing for fear that they might be treated similarly, damaging Wiki. You may feel that some people ought to be intimidated from authoring or editing here, but that is not your decision to make. What if someone considered that it was in Wiki's interests that you should be exposed and """"named and shamed"""" in this way, as a persistent offender, and your name splashed over wikiland, as a repeat offender? Not good. Encouraging people to treat posts by a particular member differently based on their identity and supposed motivations, encourages Wikipedia:Stalking. You'll notice that so far I have been extremely tolerant of these anonymous posts, in the hope that by replying politely enough times, the message will get through that it is better to debate constructively and politely than to fling mud.

Wikipedia has a couple policies that prohibit what you're doing:
Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider, and it should not store personal homepages.
Articles on people must be notable, or risk deletion

If you wish to store personal stuff, then you shouldn't use Wikipedia for it, since Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.

33d3812382a3915f,"""::::No, the Schofield text rarely makes claims of the """"first"""" sort. That is one of its major problems, actually. It doesn't effectively place Priestley in his historical milieu. I had to rely on other sources, such as Tapper to do that. Most of the generalized statements about Priestley's importance do not come from Schofield. I would not rely on the JP: A Comet in the System book. It is not the most reliable text we have (see publication information) and citing a dissertation is, sad to say, not the first line of defense. I already listed that Schofield quote above, which shows Priestley's indebtedness to other eighteenth-century thinkers. That list is more reliable, in my opinion.

ffa9f9f89523e3ff,"""""""in the way of God"""" ==

i found some material of relevance in Reuven Firestone's work """"Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam"""" (Oxford University Press) related to this current dispute. i wasn't actually looking for it, but came across it while looking for something else. anyway (p. 17):

The meaning of jihad
The semantic meaning of the Arabic term jihād has no relation to holy war or even war in general. It derives, rather from the root j.h.d., the meaning of which is to strive, exert oneself, or take extraordinary pains. Jihād is a verbal noun of the third Arabic form of the root jahada, which is defined classically as """"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation."""" 14 Such an object is often categorized in the literature as deriving from one of three sources: a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self. There are, therefore, many kinds of jihād, and most have nothing to do with warfare. """"Jihād of the heart,"""" for example, denotes struggle against one's own sinful inclinations, while """"jihād of the tongue"""" requires speaking on behalf of the good and forbidding evil. 15 ...

(removed large quote from a narration about the varying kinds of jihad)

... Muhammad is also credited with saying: """"The best jihād is [speaking] a word of justice to a tyrannical ruler."""" 17 The qualifying phrase """"in the path of God"""" (fi sabīl Allah) specifically distinguishes the activity of jihād as furthering or promoting God's kingdom on earth. It can be done, for example, by simply striving to behave ethically and by speaking without causing harm to others or by actively defending Islam and propagating the faith. Jihād as religiously grounded warfare, sometimes referred to as """"jihād of the sword"""" (jihād al-sayf), is subsumed under the last two categories of defending Islam and propagating the faith, though these need not be accomplished only through war. When the term is used without qualifiers such as """"of the heart"""" or """"of the tongue,"""" however, it is universally understood as war on behalf of Islam (equivalent to """"jihād of the sword""""), and the merits of engaging in such jihād are described plentifully in the most-respected religious works. 18 Nevertheless, Muslim thinkers, and particularly ascetics and mystics, often differentiate between the """"greater jihād"""" (al-jihād al-akbar) and the """"lesser jihād"""" (al-jihād al-asghar), with the former representing the struggle against the self and only the """"lesser jihād"""" referring to warring in the path of God. 19 

 

Itaqallah, how was my suggested addition from Britannica Encyclopedia on the five types of jihad.  

I have no problem with """"in the way of God"""", since the sentence is phrased as giving jihad's meaning, not its literal meaning. -  

Another problem with the article is that it fails to mention the new interpretations of jihad (on the behalf of some renowned scholars) which disagree with usage of warfare except in defense.  
Too bad those guys weren't around during Muhammad's time.  
One can always fnd some quotes like the two above in a serious book on jihad. However, 99 percent of Firestone's work is about, yes, warfare.  Or

eaced3158ee79489,"""Regarding your speedy deletion of my article The Resonance Project

I'm unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper """"talk"""" process.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another """"compatible"""" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the """"substitute"""" puppy you decide to offer them.
(see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""").

It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you """"produce"""" who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.
  
You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you """"produce"""" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any independent references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), and your own literature (except some very limited information by Dr. Padgett and numerous and ri",0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe a """"purgatory in RC teaching"""" would be a good idea, maybe it would be a bad idea.  Right now, I'm just thinking about the audacious move, which I oppose for its own sake, other issues aside.  The move is a separate matter from the content, since everything about it was wrong.  As for you and I, I know we disagree on some things, but that's to be expected - people disagree.  In the end it probably makes a better article.  But neither you nor I have the desire to do anything disrespectful, audacious, or flagrantly inconsiderate.    

Well, two of our big things round these parts are Be Bold and Ignore all rules.  Which is to say, whether Abtract was bold and audacious or not, there's no sense stressing over spilt milk   we should make our decisions not based on the audaciousness of the action, but on the appropriateness of the outcome.   

I sort of have mixed feelings about the whole thing myself, but I'm content to let the experiment breathe for a while, because having two pages will forestall a more pointed content dispute.  Thus far, people have been pretty gentle with you and Lima, but many people (not me) are losing patience.  To have to pages is to avoid a content dispute that would be heated, but in which your POV would almost certainly wind up on the losing end.

So, even though I agree that the move was more bold than I myself tend to be, ultimately, I think it may be a good thing.    t""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Since we're NOT SUPPOSED TO SPECULATE on Wikipedia, calling it a hack is against the rules you so properly city.  We have NO evidence of a hack, other than Phil Jones' self-serving accusation (just as we have NO evidence of global warming, other than Phil Jones' cooked books and his computer code full of """"fudge factors"""" that are all positive for recent years, and negative for times decades ago.  When the CRU presents evidence of a hack, it can be called a hack.  Until such time, Occam's Razor leans towards it being either the act of a whistle-blower, or (since there is significant evidence in both the computer code itself, and in previous errant leaks of accidentally putting files on a web server that they did not intend to release) that this is typical data mismanagement because Jones and CRU apparently wouldn't hire anybody with any IT professionals (for fear that anyone outside the cabal would have blown the whistle a decade ago?)  In any event, there is NO EVIDENCE of outside intrusion into CRU, so claiming that it was a hack is fraudulent.  Just like Jones.   09:32, 3 December""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Look, I am a proud former US Marine, so I am as against """"Terrorisim"""" as anyone. I don not consider the IRA """"Terrorists"""" in the same vein as Al Qaida, HAMAS or Hezbollah, or for that matter the UVF or UDA. The reason for thuis, is that unlike all these other groups, the VAST majority of IRA victims have been Soldiers, Police or Loyalist terrorists. Having said that, I have never once put any bias into either the PIRA or INLA articles. The fact is that """"Lost Lives"""", British Rights Watch, the US State Dept. and Janes Intelligence, ALL, quote the same numbers and figures I have for both the IRA and INLA. The difference between you and I, is that I use multiple sources, where as you use 1 source. CAIN is a estimate of figures, which are disputed by all the other aforementioned sources. You can't keep reverting a page, just because you are unaware of a siurce, or because it doesen't fit in with your personal beliefs. CNN just had a whole article on how schools are not allowing students in High School and Mid School to use Wikipedia for report's, because Wikipedia has so many articles with factual errors. this isn't the fault of Wikipedia, but of people such as yourself, who are either to lazy, to biased or to arrogant to allow for facts to be presented that conflict with your own views.

For example. The Council On Foreign Relations (a highly admired US think tank), says the following under the group """"Loyalist Paramilitaries"""" FAQ.

""""Have the loyalist groups targeted civilians?

Yes—and more frequently than the IRA. Between 1968 and 1998, loyalist paramilitaries killed an estimated 864 civilians (most of them Catholic), compared with an estimated 528 civilians (most of them Protestant) killed by the IRA. Experts say loyalist groups have often acted out of religious hatred, while the IRA has more often targeted British security officers—killing more than 1,000 of them—in an effort to further its political goal of ejecting the British from Northern Ireland"""" .
(end)

That is from a highly regarded source, and also Jane's intelligence, British Rights Watch, and """"Lost Lives"""" give the exact same number of IRA innocent victims vs UDA/UVF/LVF victims. I put this in the article and properly sourced it, yet it has been continually reverted by you to claim that the IRA has killed more innocent civillians then """"any other group in Northern reland"""". That is just factually wrong. Even CAIN research shows that the Loyalist groups have killed more civillians then the IRA. The above mentioned sources also give almost identical numbers to the Number of overall IRA victims, and breaks them down into Soldier, SAS, Police, UDR, UDA/UVF/LVF and so on. The number of IRA/Sinn Fein or INLA members killed by Loyalist groups is given at 45 in total from 1969-2001. Of this number 20 were Sinn Fein, 10 were IRA and 15 were INLA. The number of UDA/UVF/LVF and other loyalist terrorists killed by the IRA and INLA is given as 110. 90 are attributed to the IRA from 1969-1998, and 20 are attributed to the INLA from 1976-2001. Those are the numbers, I didn't make them up, if you have issue with them, go complain to the above sources. For these figures to not be included in the PIRA and INLA articles is an insult to the work I did trying to find all of them, from such different sources.

Totoro and Shinto
I don't believe the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" is necessary. Totoro has nothing to do with anything religious. Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.  

You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for """"shintoist"""" although there is the word for """"Buddhist"""", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like """"shintoist"""". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion. 
Totoro is nothing religious. Repeat, the appearance of the shrine doesn't mean Totoro has shintoist themes. I must say that to see Totoro religious is only a biased viewpoint. If there're no dissenting opinions, I will erase the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" on the 24 of April, a week after my first note on the issue.  

True, Totoro is not religious, but there are significant Shinto themes throughout the film. The Totoro are forest/nature spirits, the tree where they live is part of a shrine, and so on. Having Shinto themes does not mean Miyazaki was trying to get across some religious point. Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that. I do find it odd how you reply to yourself above, and appear to be arguing with yourself.···? · Talk to Nihonjoe 

No, I didn't talk to myself. I wanted to say some more. That's all.  

Although I reverted the deletion of this section (see following thread), I have no familiarity with this topic and no opinion whether this section belongs in the article or not.  ☎ 

I agree with Michael Friedrich. All the spiritual creatures appearing in Totoro (totoro/troll, cat-bus, etc.) have as little resemblance to traditional Japanese/shinto spirits as monsters from Nausicaä in contrast to those from Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away that have more expressly Japanese looks and names. 

In either way, unless the author of the section have reliable sources to back up his interpretation of this film in there, it should be removed. A couple of sentence that cite McCarthy's article may stay, but the rest appears to be a product of original research.

 Perhaps... 

Perhaps you didn't read the article, which did have cited evidence of IP users being effective members of the community, and evidence. So I shall quote a piece of it here:

""""A large portion of our good edits come from IP addresses; positive experiences with initial IP edits lead users to create accounts who otherwise would not do so; recent changes disabling IPs from creating new or editing semiprotected articles are sufficient. According to Jimbo Wales, """"what is commonly called 'anonymous' editing is not particularly anonymous ... and there are good reasons to want vandals on ip numbers instead of accounts."""" While about 97% of vandalism comes from anonymous users, about  or 82% of anonymous edits are intended to improve the encyclopedia. (Prohibiting IP edits would not eliminate 97% of all vandalism, because if they have to, those inclined to vandalism could easily take the 10 seconds to register.) The ability of anyone to edit articles without registering is a Foundation issue.""""

IP users are an important part of the community. Don't hate.

I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television.  This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).

RE: Carter and Apartheid -  The article should mention that he was not plowing new ground.
More than one Jewish - Israeli """"historian"""" - real historians, really - preceded him
in the discovery that Israel acts just like South Africa did. I was surprised to see
the indignation expressed when Carter's book was first released. I thought then, and
still do, that it was feigned indignation for press consumption only. Without knowing
who expressed their hurt feelings - I bet I can guess as to who at least a half dozen
of the usual suspects are, sight unseen. I repeat, and the article should at least mention once, that equating - noticing - that Israel and its former staunch ally south Africa was not totally new with Carter, heck we ( my friends,family and I ) made the obvious observation years before the historians - decades before Carter ( at least publically) 159.105.80.141  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since this is not an article, but a sandbox draft, I don't know what to edit. I'll edit it here:

Note: You *almost got it right* but, the subject of the article is not the term, but the myth (or, shall we say controversy) about the term. The *argument* should be the subject.

""""Democrat Party"""" is a term used in the United States instead of """"Democratic Party"""" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer """"they are the only true adherents of democracy.""""[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term """"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.""""[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only """"deeply committed"""" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is """"trivial"""".[2][3] [4]

History of usage
The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, """"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.""""[5]

William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled """"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'""""[7]

Do you see the difference? All the way through, the dispute about the term should be the subject of the article, not whether it *really* means one thing or another.

I have repeatedly attempted to communicate with Wikipedia with a simple request.

Virtually all attempts have been blocked. I am not appealing for arbitration.

My contributions were deemed to be """"original research"""", the accusation was made that I had never given a valid citation to support them. I repeatedly posted the citation, even going so far as to quote the text. This was rejected by an editor repeatedly as being without merit despite my requests that said editor at least check the citation. Every time the only reply of the editor was that I had given NO citation. I have no problem if the Wikipedia would rather accept a charge that a citation was never given even if the citation - in fact the total quotation of the source material, as used in the citation - was submitted three times.

This is the judgement of Wikipedia. My request is very simple. As I stand accused of """"original research"""" for repeating in toto the source material (a short telegram) which was likewise published in toto in what was by every standard a legitimate source for the Wikipedia. And as I stand accused of repeated - and admittedly passionate - pleadings for the editor to check the citation, and stand accused for doing so, then all I want is to terminate my account and removed those contributions to the Wikipedia I have made.

If my scholarship is not worthy of the Wikipedia then why would you want to keep it? 

If my defense of my scholarship by portraying the activities of a person who refused it, despite the fact that it was printed in toto in a legitimate source, as """"original scholarship"""" as """"obstreperous,"""" then all I can say is that my application of the word is within it's dictionary definition.

I am not asking that the block on editing be removed. I am not asking for some """"vindication.'I am asking for no consequence to anyone. I am simply asking the Wikipedia to carryout what it must if my work is without merit because I have never cited any valid references for my edits.

If my work is worthless, without merit and """"original research,"""" then the Wikipedia by it's own standards MUST remove it.

If the Wikipedia will not do this then what can I do but try to enforce the actions and stated standards of Wikipedia by taking you to court.

I would rather not see that.

Have a nice one!

 Less jargon 

This is a good article, but in a few sections there is too much aviation jargon or unexplained technical detail. For example, it refers to """"the high alpha needed at rotation"""". What is an alpha?  (What is rotation?).  As another example, there is no explanation (or citation...) of the following statement: """"63% of the aircraft's thrust is attributed to the intakes whilst the exhaust nozzles generate 29% and the engines just 8% of the thrust"""". What is a non-aviation reader to make of this statement? How can the engines only produce 8% of the thrust?

The name is, to be blunt, nonsensical. No actual 10-string guitarist or authority on this instrument uses this terminology, which is entirely 's own creation. Why the anachronistic """"classical""""? Neither the 10-stringed harp-guitar of the 19th century nor the modern 10-string guitar is an instrument from the Classical period, and an acoustic guitar is as little limited to the performance of so-called """"Classical"""" music as an acoustic piano is. And what exactly is meant by """"extended-range""""? Extended from what? This is assuming that the guitar had a fixed range, which is a fallacy considering most of the notable guitarists of the 19th century (Sor, Carulli, Coste, Mertz, Legnani, Manjon, etc.) also wrote for/performed on guitars with more than 6 strings, many of which had a treble range that was extended beyond the 19th/20th fret that is the norm on today's guitars. All in all this is a nonsensical title for an article that should simply be called """"ten-string guitar"""" that that should include only historically significant instruments (i.e. not things like the Marlow 10-string guitar). And there should be a separate article for the """"Yepes 10-string guitar"""", which this article currently simply continues to confuse with unrelated developements that have nothing to do with the primary defining characteristic of the Yepes instrument: its singualr tuning which uniquely gives sympathetic string resonance in unison with any note fretted on the treble strings.

Theories of evolution: A theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history (e.g. Out of Africa Theory, Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)

 THF's conflict of interest and complaints 

This article is not primarily about the UK; it covers the US, Australia and NZ and the UK too. There has been no mention here of why that should be so, and turning this page into a US tort reform page is not appropriate.
The """"neutrality"""" tag and """"original research"""" tag was put up by THF, who works for a right wing lobbyist; Cool Hand Luke wishes to keep them in because he appears to be following up old grudges, as can be seen from the conflict of interest entry for THF above. He has, ironically, deleted a good reference to US law, and does not seem to actually be concerned about approving the article.
So, a third opinion of someone who is interested in approving the article, preferably with some knowledge of debate about the tort system outside the US as well as in, would be useful.

bada179159181c94,""":It seems that you are right that the words of Rawat's mother were added  not mixed with, which leaves open the possibility of being obviously and thus deceptively interwoven, but added to some quotes of Rawat's in the quotes section of EPO.  But even a cynic like yourself must concede that it was probably an honest mistake.  First, there isn't a single other case of false attribution, mistaken or otherwise, that's ever been made out against EPO that I can recall.  John and Jean-Michel who've done most, if not all, the work have been meticulous throughout.  Plus, they have openly invited corrections if and when any mistakes were noted.  This is an opportunity for you, then, to make EPO even better.  Congratulations for doing a small part in bringing the truth about Rawat to the general publice.

Also, the Mata Ji quote is in a set of sample quotes from the book, Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji?.  It is just that.  The only error is that the quotes are in the section of Rawat's own quotes and not the more general category of all quotes of interest.  In other words a simple mistake just like you said. On the other hand, you also make accusations of quotes """"out of context"""".  You have offered no support at all for this accusation.  It's time you did or gave up that scurrilous accusation. On that score, you also alleged that the editors of the above book themselves wrote some of the quotes in question.  Where's your evidence for that?  I say there's none and if you know better now's the time to show your proof.  Otherwise, why say it?

But what's really funny is how you yourself are so clearly guilty of doing just that, taking quotes out of context.  For some reason you felt compelled to drag in comments from an ex-premie forum here.  Whatever the wisdom of that, you'd think you, a serious academic with a keen eye for """"contextual abuse"""" would know better than to say that I said you """"need to be slapped in the face"""" when what I really said was:

""""Her entire thesis is offensive and unsubstantiated by the evidence.  She deserves the academic equivalent of a slap in the face."""" (My emphasis).  

If you can't tell the difference, you're not fit to do the kind of careful analysis you purport to do.  If you can tell the difference, you're being purposely misleading and provocative.  Your choice.

Just because the gay Wikiproject believes things should be done a certain way and there is little dissent within the Wikiproject, does not mean that this is how things should be done in articles seemingly important to their eyes.  After all, James is a political and religious figure infitessimally more important to analyze or discuss in much less personal terms than having to do with sexuality or other habits.  After all, James wrote a treatise on smoking as repellant, but this is not so big a deal because of its lack in uniqueness or value in comparison to his policies.  Most gay Wikiproject participants admittedly find James a guilty hypocrite for all done in his name by fundamentalists, against gays.  This is essentially the problem.  The gay Wikiproject is taking a side and setting it into stone, all the while decrying """"persecution!"""" when the odds and ends of Wikipedians here and there in the Wikipedia community find a problem with saying that James was """"indeed, gay!"""" without proof, just a conflict of views that are veritably lost in time.  The gay Wikiproject takes speculation and purposeful homophobic defamation of the king's character and turn it into a monumental case or trial on homosexuality, probably about the king's motives in the King James Version Bible and verses used to support condemnation of homosexuality.  Don't take this personal!  The life of James has everything to do with a new and unstable, sometimes tyrannical government in power.  It has little veracity with regards to sexual conspiracies, unless one follows the king's involvement in aid to """"favourite"""" Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset in trying to take another man's wife by murdering her legal husband.

The user you reported to AIV has only made one edit to Wikipedia and was already warned for that by anti-vandal bot .  I appreciate that the edit was to a BLP and contained profane language but we would not normally block someone after just one edit, doing so would be considered very bitey as can reporting someone after one edit.

In this case the editor hasn't even edited after ClueBot's warning so I'm not altogether sure why another warning was issued.

Finally, when making a report to AIV in the future, please do not quote the vandalism.  Because the vandalism contained profane language part of your report to AIV has had to be removed from the public archives.  Any question please ask me on my talk page.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your sig... 

I'm curious as to how you're signing off. Are you doing ~~~~, or are you typing it by hand? Your signature should always be linked to your user page, talk page, or both, just as a heads up. 

Also, whilst it's always great to have new vandal fighters, you've been one of the very rare people who go straight into full on vandalfighting straight from creating an account. It's something that we don't tend to recommend because a lot of the tools are really easy to go wrong on. I know when I first used Twinkle I somehow managed to screw that up as well. 

But besides that, I'm sure having one more vandal fighter, regardless how new, is never a bad thing for Wikipedia, right? So my suggestion to you would be to get adopted by a more experienced user. (I'm still learning the ropes myself, and being adopted has been immensely helpful, if only to know that there's people I can go to for help.) Wikipedia is a really hard community to become part of sometimes, and I'm afraid you've been one of those who's had a bit of a rough time getting settled. I hope it does get better for you- and I think getting mentored by someone will help you greatly with that.

287b13cfeb895d86,"Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy

Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement.  Any choice of target
redistributes from some groups to others - making some worse off.
For example, high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt - including
pensioneers, holders of fixed income securities, employees with protected
jobs and annuity-like compensation (including most government employees,
and policy makers, and most tenured academics), and creditors.  It benefits
net debtors - particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest
rate caps.  It also benefits owners of commodities, real estate, foreign currencies,
equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and
offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed.  Low inflation benefits
holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country,
importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions
and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees,
and policy makers).  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers -
increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets,
and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate,
owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed.

In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement),
however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political 
resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical.

To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer
of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool 
and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies.

Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy
targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, 
debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants
in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities  
and real estate, and the precariously employed

If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency
impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within
and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move
an economy away from an efficient frontier.

Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents 

From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face 
a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the
form of a secure fixed annuity.  This would incentivize them to favor
tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth.
Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related
to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly
loose monetary policy.  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth 
contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their
overall moral hazard.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please allow me to quote < 1 KB   If an article or list has remained this size for over a couple of months, consider combining it with a related page.Actually I got the idea after looking at Sidoarjo which has subdistrict information like I did. But, then I extended it further with the village information. Since my daily work does not related to that information of course I have to build it from scratch. However, I did as careful as I can. I always use pertinent information or previous works (for instance Sidoarjo) as reference. And more important, I never have any intention to screw wikipedia and I get no personal benefit at all by this contribution. But, frankly speaking, the response that I get is really really disappointed me. I feel that I was treated like an intruder rather than a volunteer which usually get proper respect. Anyway, I'll try to continue my work unless my work get unproper action again. By that time I think I should forget my good will for contributing.

There's a lot to learn when you first start editing Wikipedia, and it can be overwhelming to try to learn it all at once. It may be good to look at some high quality artistic biographies on Wikipedia, such as Bronwyn Bancroft or Dave Stamper to see how those articles do things. 
I've cleaned up your draft a lot. If you click """"View history"""" on the page, you can see the various changes that I made. For instance, with this edit I added several wikilinks. With this edit, I created an introductory sentence, so the reader can know instantly who she is and why she is important.
This next edit is very important: in it I changed the references to use  tags, so that individual statements are sourced. Notice how the first time I cite a source, I use the format url.com. When I later want to use the same reference, I only use the format . If you add more statements from these or other sources, you can reference them in the same way.
I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well. But it should only need another sentence or two before you move it into article-space, at Anneliese von Oettingen. I can help with that too, if you like. All the best, –  (talk)

 Another possible remedy is the consumption of motion-sickness medicine or over the counter allergy medicine.  Specifially, consuming cetirizine prior to consuming alcohol is reported to counter the hangover.
Supposed remedies

Note: Most of these have not been scientifically tested or reviewed in the above articles.
 Water: this has been recommended scientifically. Hangovers are mainly dehydration; therefore drinking water before, during and after a drinking session will greatly decrease any hangover symptoms. A glass of water between each alcoholic drink is the best way to reduce hangover, as you won't easily become dehydrated; this also causes you to drink fewer alcoholic beverages. Drink as much water before sleeping as possible (within reason). It may not totally prevent a hangover but it will reduce headache. Continuing to drink water may help to alleviate symptoms more quickly.
 Nux vomica (homeopathic remedy)
 Milk Thistle
 Angostura bitters and soda water
 Defecation
 Vomiting
 Professional massage, reflexology (foot), and other detoxifying practices.
 A glass of buttermilk. Though many people dislike buttermilk, it will calm down your stomach and add liquid to the body.
 Having sex (or masturbation) may increase the release of endorphins, which in turn may help reduce the effect of a hangover.
 Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages.  Caffeine increases the effectiveness of analgesics, and therefore may reduce headache severity when used with aspirin or similar medicines.  Coffee has also been shown in some studies to have a protective effect on the liver, effective in preventing alcoholic liver disease. (Caffeine is a diuretic, which would further dehydrate the body. This is generally not a recommended remedy. Thus, tea, especially green tea, is indicated.)
 Nicotine, once again much like caffeine, increases the effectiveness of analgesics and its stimulant effects diminishes many hangover symptoms.
 Cabbage leaves or tomato juice
 Bloody Mary
 Michelada (popular in Mexico; one part tomato juice, one part beer, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi sauce or Soy sauce)
 Mixing in a tall glass two raw eggs with pepper, Tabasco sauce, and gin. Although the cysteine in the egg yolk may have a mild benefit, the pepper, Tabasco, and gin will have a negative impact.  Colloquially known as a """"Prairie Oyster"""".
 Drinking more alcohol is scientifically proven (see hair of the dog), a well-liked remedy. This will, however, only delay the hangover 
 Eating seafood is a popular """"remedy"""" in Chile.
 Coca Cola or Pepsi-Cola, otherwise known as """"Black Aspirin"""" (popular in Australia), also """"The Red Ambulance"""" (South African); the caffeine, bubbles and sugar can be easier to hold down than pure water.  Moreover, the low pH helps the enzymes in the stomach and the sucrose partially compensates the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis. 
 Taking a shower and oscillating between extreme cold and hot temperatures.  This practice has no effect on the hangover and can be unhealthy. Seen in the movie The Princess Bride.
 Eating canned asparagus before going to bed, purportedly a good cure thanks to the diuretic effects of asparagus.  Again, diuretics compound the problem.
 Ginseng tea is given to relieve the effects of alcohol.  If useful, it may be for its antioxidant and-or vasodilatation / microcirculation properties.
 Drinking a couple of table spoons of olive oil is said to be of great help

Common folk medicine has a wide variety of supposed hangover cures. A good hangover cure should replace essential nutrients lost by the body while counteracting the influence of residual poisons; very few cures do both at once. Among the more common proposed cures are:

My point, which I made here on Krill’s talk page, is that I have made many, conflict-free contributions to MOSNUM on issues not related to date linking.

There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.

The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.

Don't try to advice myself regarding an minor incident, you are disturbing my self on an issue outside wikipedia, there are facts to be proven. Such hypocrites (like you) have no real reputation in real world, I'm acting on anti fascist and anti terrorist propaganda not from any extremist or bias perspective. I don't care how much you bother my self still there are methods to post on wikipedia without an account. However  trolling is not a harmful action, different people has different p.o.v.s. Further on you P.S; Wikipedia is not something to be expanded through discussion or being bold. Literary it is an communication method of which leads others to overcome questions in real life or practice contemporary issues such as terrorism, politics or religious extremism.

 On the """"Freddie's Mart"""" Controversey 
 Reliable sources that also include this very article collaborating info I and many others have received concerning the case of Freddie's Mart's landlord who was never cited by Sharpton! As for Rev. Al's perfidy concerning the UAM and Alton Maddox, who it must be strenuously reiterated rescued Alfred from the wrath of Morganthau, the New York State Attorney's office again and again!

(That earlier iteration is to all purposes now ommitted from viewing unless the author decides to put these item back in. I also noticed that there are many facts added to the present article; others understandbly taken out.)  Rev. Al doesn't make reference to this affiliation in any detail in his auto-bio, but that is the nature and restriction of such tomes:  What is not said is left for others to investigate.

Current Squad
I propose redoing the current squad list a bit (for all South African teams). During the first half of the year, the top players will play Super Rugby for the Bulls; during the second half, some of them will play for the Springboks. I suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the Blue Bulls, but also indicate if they play at national team level, at Super Rugby level, at Currie Cup level or at Vodacom Cup level only.

With the current format, I think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator. Something like:

Props
  Dean Greyling (NT)
  Rayno Gerber (SR)
  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)
  Basil Short (VC)

Hooker
  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)
(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012

The indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.

However, an alternate representation could be:

 PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle

This could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.

Serbian casualties again

Just one link more, to the already existing ones numbered above: http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199711/71128-026-trae-beo.htm 
It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll (in battles- civilian Serbian casualties are, as usual, inflated beyond & beyond..). The reason ? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self-image of a Ramboid nation); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone's national sensibilities aside-it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8.000.  

The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica (a typical Croatian name) so it again represents a Croatian press POV.

Here's another nice example of nationalist logic. What you're basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian, is that it? Infact, you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man's NAME. What if he changed his name, maybe he would be more neutral then, what do you think?  

Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10.000.
According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2,300., and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that """"most experts agree with the figure"""". 
There are no reason to put 8.000 or 10.000 as official data. These data are contraversial. 
Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10.000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book """"Bitka za Vukovar"""", put the highest limit around 12.000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say-exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is not deaf, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus's estimates. It is explicit. Therefore, reverted.

How neutral are you as an administrator or Sitush is when none of you guys are commenting on the scientfic study. Someone mentione dthat this study is old so it is not a good study to rely as it was conducted 40-50 years ago. What kind if argument was this?

However, you could use the same argument to delete almost everything in the article because many encyclopedias include a description of Jimmu so short it doesn't even cover things like the origins of his name and title and the issue of his historicity. In regards to the consensus of Wikipedia editors, and I'm not referring to Flying Tiger, when Nishidani proposed that in the long run we discuss all aspects of Jimmu's memory from start to finish, including medieval and Tokugawa times, historiography, and popular culture, most users who commented agreed with that even though it's safe to say that no encyclopedias cover these last three things. It's certain that people in Japan made a clear link between Hakko Ichiu and Jimmu and if you had done a less restrictive book search, you would still have found no fewer than 430 English language sources noting this connection, including the reliable sources this article cites like Edwards, Dower, Earhart, Ruoff, and Brownlee. For instance, Emperor Hirohito evidently referred to Jimmu when he said """"It has been the great instruction bequeathed by Our Imperial Foundress (the Sun Goddess) and other Imperial Ancestors that our grand moral obligation should be extended to all directions and the world be unified under one roof."""" As historian James McClain notes """"As every Japanese schoolchild who had read Kokutai no Hongi knew by heart, hakko ichiu meant 'eight cords, one roof' and first appeared in the eighth-century chronicle Nihon Shoki."""" The association between Jimmu and Hakko Ichiu was extensively cultivated in wartime Japan, most scholars are aware of that, and it is highly relevant for Wikipedia purposes. Concerning our four sentences on Hakko Ichiu, for now I'd say we can shorten it to three if necessary, possibly deleting the sentence cited to Bix, but otherwise I see no reason or consensus to trim it back further than that. Frankly, as the article gradually expands there is even more that can be eventually noted here such as perhaps uchiteshi yamamu, the other wartime phrase attributed to Jimmu, or possibly Okawa Shumei's establishment of the Jimmu Society. The resurrection of the Jimmu propaganda machine in modern times does not need to be downplayed for fear of """"completely ignorant anti-Japanese POV-pushers"""".

Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the """"Articles of Confederation"""" from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. — 21:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I hold a bachelor's degree in history from the most prestigious public university in the United States.  I am well-aware of all of the facts you just mentioned, especially the delicate fragility of the Union throughout its first century.  I am also familiar with all the diverse what-if scenarios.  

I do not have all day to write on talk pages.  I did not think it was necessary to rehash the convoluted details of two centuries of American history just to explain how we got to our present pigpen of legal fictions and political realities.  But thanks for doing that for me.  

When I said """"wording"""" above, I was referring to the consistent use of the definite article, """"the,"""" rather than the plural demonstrative adjective, """"these,"""" in the Constitution.  But you did clarify something I neglected, the task of explaining why the Constitution has to refer to states which are united, as opposed to, say, """"the United State.""""

 Vandalism protection 

I know the vandalism is now infrequent, but is it necessary?  I don't think so since so many people watch this page anyway...  (talk) 20:31, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Republicans and religious Jews 

Excuse me.  In the """"Politics"""" section, the following sentence appears:

The Republicans generally receive more funding and support from business groups, religious Christians and Jews, and rural Americans, while the Democratic party receives more support from labor unions and minority ethnic groups.

In the history,  sliced out the phrase """"and Jews"""" and then  promptly reverted it.  Now, I'm a little confused.  Historically, when Jews are considered as a voting bloc, they tend to lean Democratic.  However, this analysis has always considered Jews as a single ethnic class and not separated out religious Jews from non-religious Jews.  Therefore, my question:

Does anyone have evidence that religious Jews tend to vote Republican (or Democratic)?

The second is that translations are difficult and often there's a thin line between literal translations becoming unreadable to a modern reader, and interpretations that help with understanding the original texts.  There's many """"introductions"""" to Aristotle that make this point.  Aristotle in outline By Timothy A. Robinson or Aristotle By Christopher John Shields make similar points, as does A new Aristotle reader By Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill.  The Clarendon translations are often cited as being a set of references translations, translates the passage as """"In this sea are situated two very large islands, the so-called British Isles, Albion and lerne, which are greater than any which we have yet mentioned and lie beyond the land of the Celts"""".

AGF?  You basically told me to buzz off when I asked you about it.  AGF is NOT an excuse to just shove crap into the encyclopedia.  Why, just because you are part of some organized event to do something do think that means you should get a pass on doing it right?  You could have said something like, """"Good Idea mate.  I'll remember that in the future.""""  and added the damn name of the city into the article. That would have been AGF on your part.  But instead you give some flimsy excuse that you are participating in some project as a reason not to do it right.  That is not AGF.  Did you actually think that the city name wasn't an important part of the article?  It would have taken you less time to add the city name than it did to write me back.  I have no idea what state Freemantle is in, or i would have done it myself.  It would have taken you less time to add the reference to the article than it did to put it in the Afd, which, by the way, you still haven't done.  Once it is notable, I will be happy to withdraw the AfD. Your article did not meet notability.  You had the info at hand to get it there, but rather than putting it in the article, you are instead arguing about it at AfD.  Is it your expectation that someone should come along and clean up after you?  If you don't have a complete article, draft it in userspace until you do.  BTW, you are the only one showing an attitude of OWN.  I haven't even edited on the article, how could I be showing OWN?  The ONLY reason to edit on Wikipedia is to improve the encyclopedia, not to create some benefit to a local organization.  My gripe in general is probably not with you, but with the event's organizer.  However, you certainly could have responded in a more productive way.  I will repeat, if the project you are involved in is not telling you that the reason to create articles in Wikipedia is to improve the encyclopedia, they are doing you a disservice.  Your article was, and is, not meeting WP:GNG.  It was probably not the best idea on my part to nominate it at Afd, but what is done is done.  Fix it and I will be happy to withdraw it.  This conversation started with a helpful hint to a new editor.  Try graciously accepting advice and this never would have happened.

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1,0,0,0,0,0

The opponent calling me hysterical did so when I had not posted anythiing at all so you should read the page again, what is written in capital letter was inserted long after the texts previous to it and after it had been written, so you can see that he is asking for my banishment for no reasons at all.
I have not being editing ANYTHING AT ALL on this site and you know that.
YBM has been editing all my writtings on it from the beginning also those of a user called Laurence but you never noticed it and do not blame him for that WHY? does he have the right to do it or are you just YBM himself?
I don't see why you are talking about people who cannot read french as all I read is written in english and the links you talk about show a webside with links in it to the same contain in english and in german. Things you will know if you had consulted them instead of attacking me.
You talk about yelling I am attackt for no reason and have to be subject to punishments which I do not deserve, and that you impose on me unjustified.
All the reason you evoce her do not exist.
I do not have edit anyone but my own texts.
I write in english
My links show a place written in 3 different languages.
Links shown by other also show french web site in french like fr. physic and there is links on the french site about the bogdanov affair who show web site in english, so what you are saying is rabbish, and od not constitute an excuse for expulsion but are low argumentation to show an excuse to through me out, exactly as YBM did.
The links i showed are not a web site about the bogdanov but about Voyer and YBM who act as a prove that the motives of YBM in that affair are not to conduct a scientific evaluation of the theory advanced by the Bogdanov, but a social experiment about manipulation of the masses and of evidences, as it is described in the web site which links are available in my column. Another link show what Voyer and YBM did to 2 other writers, a man ans a woman, previously to that affair, and show that he used of exactly the same tool as for this one, and that he stopped doing it when he begin to take care of the Bogdanovs affair. He is insulting the writters abondantly and even show the cover of their books with the title """"de la merde!"""" made in such a way to appear like if it was its real title.
I would like you to come forword with prove that I edited somebody text 'cause I dont see any.
As for your 2 texts above I do not see what is the problem with them so explain yourself.
What do you mean by threat? what kind of threat?
I do read on YBM column a threat to get me banished and a threat to get me ignored and a threat to deleete all my texts no matter what I write with links to wiki revert function, which is illegal by wikis rules, and a threat to get presented as a vandaliser of the site with a link to do it, even so I did not have written a word about it.
What do you mean I am not talking about the subject? Where?
I am firmly keeping the subject: there is no error what so ever in the Bogdanovs book and in their thesis, there is no attempt on their part at lying or at making a bluff out of science, there is people who pretend to be what they are not and pretend to detain evidences of something they barely understand, and who constantly insult the Bogdanovs and anyone who do not have the same opi8nion as they have, who insult the Bogdanovs famili, teachers, physical appearence, life, friends, constantly and in many forum of the internet.
This person is YBM and his associate are: Romnulphe, Voyer, rayon-z, and Max, and their name are to be followed every time YBM appear on a site about the subject.
There is plenty of links about it.
The Bogdanov have already discussed and rediscussed each and every point of the list of so called errors presented by those pseudo scientist, and have proven them wrong and other scientist have intervene too to explain how it had to be understood in theoretical physic, but yBm keep using them as if Igor had never argumented against it, and even do it in a way as if it was because he couldn't argue against it, even a fiew blog after he had got an all explaination about it.
It just doesn't make sens.
He always provocate people by personnal attacks and then reproach them to don't stick to the subject.
Thats a clear line in all his appearences on the net.
A specialist in theoritical science has once demonstrate to him how it hang together and explained each of the points he had listed, but even with that who was a perfect demonstration, he answered: I don't give a shit about it, and even if you prove me wrong on all points, I will continue anyway! he says that on fr. physic, and i put the link to it here and on the french wiki about the bogdanovs.

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura",0,0,0,0,0,0

I am bilingual and binational in Canada, which makes my cultural sensitivities and awareness a little over the top. Add arrogant Frenchmen into the mix and it makes editing French pages extremely litigious and the same vein as certain brit/american/auz litigations on language use. Some days I think that each language wikipedia needs to invent a country/region specific tool because endless regionalisms in a single intro is heavy. Another source of litigation is overuse of internet references, often these pop culture science sites are rife with distorted or misinformation, for internet references I like to limit it to webpages which are themselves well referenced or science organizations vs virtual non contactable entities (of course, as an overeducated scientist, mostly I mean in context of scientific notions) or media pages (I distrust these most).

Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it?
Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article?

A not though on the naming of the articles. Except for provincial capitals, the default convention is to name cities and towns with their name only. If there is an ambiguity (e.i. Carlos Pellegrini is also a former-president), then you add the Province's name after a comma:

 Removed genetics attack subsection 

I removed the entire following attack subsection from the """"Genetics"""" section:

===Clarification===

It is clear from the graphs contained in the 2012 Turkish Cat Genetics Study that the majority of the Turkish Angora samples submitted show only minor traces of the original Ankara Zoo cats.  Ankara Zoo sample No 9575 shows a 72.14% signature mistakenly referred to as the Cyprus group since it is also common to many Cyprus cats—whereas the Turkish Angoras of the cat fancy  show a generally insignificant but widely variable percentage this critical identifying signature. Other examples from Turkey that show these signatures are 13558, 76.77%,  and   9702, 97.02%.  Supposed samples from Turkey that matched the cat fancy Angoras cannot be verified or confirmed. In fact, the supposed authors of those samples deny any knowledge of them.
Considering that these """"scientific studies"""" from the genetics laboratory of Leslie Lyons of UC Davis assume that American Turkish Angoras are the authentic Turkish Angoras, as her website says, then cats that differ from those samples are not Turkish Angoras. This is highly flawed and misleading pseudo-science, which breeders may consider genetic proof.
Please note that the 2012 Turkish Cat Genetics Study was neither published nor is available on a webpage but consists only of an e-mail with attached graphs sent to interested Turkish cat breeders. Further details and citations may be obtainable at.-  http://www.turkishangoracat.org/arastirma.aspx?arastirmaId=1

1298cc5a880d9011,"===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=

Dear Tiptoety,

I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.

This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. 

It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  

Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  

the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  

Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:

“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”
Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? 

The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u",0,0,0,0,0,0

From Keynes' suggestion to bury FED-notes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up, to Samuelson's insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989, to Krugman's Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis.
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head. With a track record like that, of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right, that understand what economics actually is and, more importantly, what it isn't.
It's not the mainstream economists that don't take AE seriously, it's the other way around. For good reason. So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics. Like Jefferson said, you'd be better informed of current events if you didn't read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day. Likewise, you're likely to have a far better understanding of economics if you've never taken an economics course than having spent years studying Keynesianism, monetarism, neoclassicism or whatever mishmash of mainstream schools that gets taught in the universities today.",0,0,0,0,0,0

b169389106b471ea,"""I responded thusly, in a new ANI thread (the old one was long gone by the time my block ended):
A while ago, I made some edits that Johntex didn't like, and so instead of trying to resolve it on the article discussion page, he posted a wildly dishonest complaint in which he resorted to outright lying about me to get me blocked from editing the page for a month (his initial goal being to get me completely banned). I continued to be outraged at his behavior and the fact that he remains completely unpunished for his behavior, and posted complaints on his talk page. Once again, rather than trying to resolve it, he went here to lie about me in his continued belief that anyone who annoys him should be banned. And yet again, he posted numerous lies:

5 days ago, with no provocation whatsoever, Heqwm made a personal attack against me on my talk page. As explained above, the claim that there was no provocation whatsoever is an outright lie.

I have never posted lies about him. Another lie.

I left him a message on his talk page asking him to provide diffs to back up his allegations. He declined to do so. Another lie. I pointed out that I had provided him with the diffs over and OVER again, and each time he simply lied and said that they don't say what he said they clearly said.

Wizardman warned Heqwm that this was a personal attack. Heqwm repeated his personal attack on his own talk page. I removed the """"anti-barnstar"""" and personal attack from my talk page, but Heqwm re-added it. I discussed the charge on my talk page. And Johntes's recounting is dishonest, as it implies that my reposting the attack happened after Wizardman's warning, when in fact it happened before.

Heqwm has been at this mischief for a long time. Mischief? Insisting that liars be punished is """"miscief""""? What kind of world do we live in?

He has been warned by other users as well, and has been placed on a form of community probation. Yes, on the basis of the very lies that are the issue here.

I don't think I have any any interaction with him since then, so I can only assume he is still upset about being put on probation, or about the related mediation case which he filed and then abandoned. Abandoned after several weeks went by without any mediator stepping forward (and after Johntex engaged in behavior in blatant violation of WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF).

His talk page history is littered with controversy and conflict with many other editors on many topics. After several years, with me not deleting anything, there are now several instances of people disagreeing with me. And...?

I ask whether Heqwm has exhausted the community's patience? I ask whether this is not a clear threat and an instance of Johntex's bullying.

To top it off, another admin came along and blocked me only a few hours after Johtex's request, meaning that I had no opportunity to address the charges.

-

Jonhtex responded """"I request that Heqwm again be blocked for posting unsubstantiated personal attacks where he accuses me of lying.""""  So... Johntex is allowed to attack me on ANI, but if I respond to his charges, I should be blocked?  Yet another example of his bullying.  As for """"undsubstantiated, I have diffs and screenshots showing quite clearly that Johntex lied.

Thanks for your response. I just want to say that the 2 things that I believe should be changed in the article Cyrus the Great is that 
1. That he was the King of Āryāvarta
2. His influence reached till Indus River

If you go through the histories and historic maps properly then you will find that King Cyrus has never Indus. And as far as  Āryāvarta is concerned then it starts from Indus and spreads over Gangetic Plains. In history it can be clearly seen that there was no influence of King Cyrus on these areas. In fact King Cyrus' kingdom extended till today's Baluchistan province in Pakistan but have never reached till Indus River.Even the maps this article contains proves the same thing.

Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone.

 CSP is server-side (has to be configured at each server, sends reports to the server), while ABE is client-side (configured in browser, logs results in error console).
 CSP just allows or blocks content, whereas ABE can take other actions like stripping authentication.
 CSP was primarily designed to stop cross-site scripting and other injections, while ABE was primarily designed to stop cross-site request forgery (but can defeat XSS/injections too).
 CSP allows wildcards, ABE allows either wildcards or regular expressions.
 CSP specifies only hostnames, ABE can specify full addresses including protocol and path.
 ABE knows about intranet vs internet addresses and can control traffic between them (in fact, it does this by default).
 CSP doesn't try to control requests originating from privileged code eg browser extensions. ABE can, although it is always possible for privileged code to defeat this, so it cannot be relied on to protect against malicious addons.
 ABE can distinguish between different types of object inclusions and different HTTP methods.
 They can work independently; if either blocks something, it will be blocked.

His interpretation of these particular experiments is that they support Lamarck's long-discredited notion that offspring can inherit the acquired characteristics of their parents.""""

 Proposed Intervening Section on """"Controversial New York Times Story"""" 

Rather than argue over the title or contents of the disputed second section regarding the pertinence of the controversial petition itself, I propose to insert an intervening section about the controversy stirred up by the appearance of Kenneth Chang's 2006 story in the NY Times, wherein Picard's name is mentioned.  The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.

Here is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.

Controversial New York Times Story

In February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.""""Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 """"100 Scientists"""" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,"""" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, """"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."""" 

Chang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously """"dissenters from Darwinism"""" or """"anti-evolution.""""  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as """"anti-evolution"""" """"dissenters"""" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as """"dissent.""""  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.

The last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, """"A plague on both their houses.""""  

Skip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, saying

WP:AN is the right place for that.

One more from a paper presented at Yale: http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/NEUDC03/shahe.pdf - After decades of lackluster performance under the all pervasive interventionist policy regime espoused after independence (the so-called ‘License Raj’), India embarked on a major economic liberalization program in 1991, triggered by a severe balance of payments crisis.
Yet another paper from Harvard website - http://www.cid.harvard.edu/hiid/662.pdf - The pre-independence experience was combined with a very clear inspiration from the experience of the socialist countries, in particular the Soviet Union, which was reflected in the speeches of the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and in the now famous Mahalonobis model which had many similarities to the work of Feldman for the first Soviet Five year plan (see Domar (1957))11.

From another academic paper - http://www.ndu.edu/library/n4/n035604L.pdf - Remnants of Nehru’s command economy haunt virtually every aspect of India’s reform program. Even after twelve years of progress, more than 40% of the country’s capital base remains in government hands.10

Hello, I'm a moderate user of wikipedia. My Opus for this site has to be the article I wrote on Cobden, Ontario. This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article. 

Anyways, the reason I'm bothering you with this is because you seem like you would probably know a little more about wikipolicy than me and I saw you get involved before. I guess you could say I'm asking for your help and opinion. And my main question is this: Are towns not worthy, ever, of their own article?

By claiming that the word Nair is derived from the word dog, you are equating Nairs to dogs.

how to fix this article
In some kinds of academic discourse it's considered incorrect to use the term """"racism"""" to describe what are essentially racist actions by an oppressed minority. I understand, and even, in certain contexts agree with this. However, I don't see anything wrong with calling Black supremacy racist when were talking about the kind of Black supremacy that explicitly says that non-black people are inferior.

The problem I have with this article and the article on Black Power is that they both, at times, conflate the legitimate, if reactionary, anti-racist, black empowerment movements with cultish and fringe ideas and groups that have little or no currency in the greater US black community.

A comparison would be if you equated all people who are pro-life with skin heads. I bet there are a lot of pro-life skin heads, and both groups have a lot of white people in them but they don't really have anything to do with each other. (!)

In order to fix this article and the article on black power we need to realize that there are racist fringe groups, and describe them, and their history and motivation fairly.

I have a few questions: 

Is every group listed here a """"self described"""" black supremacy group? Or are some of these groups concerned about """"black power"""" (there is a difference!)

Do we represent the history of these groups and the racial climate they grew out of fairly?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

6. Princeton, NJ
7. Annapolis, MD
8. Trenton, NJ
9. New York, NY
10. Philadelphia
11. Washington, D.C.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

Thanks Flyer22 that was not my guess.  Here's what the NBC website says, the official site, not a message board: Lucas was injured when a beam fell on his legs and EJ agreed to save Lucas only if Sami agrees to let EJ have his way with her. Sami reluctantly had sex with EJ and helped him escape to Mexico, after he was wanted in connection with the shooting of John Black. Despite Sami’s attempt to turn over a new leaf, EJ returned and pressed her for information on police activities, and she was pulled into another web of deception, trying to prevent him from learning she was pregnant. That's from Sami Brady.  That tells me the show's official position is that she agreed.  What a character says and what the show's position is in this case are not the same.  Since Ed Scott took over, only Lucas has used the word and Sami and EJ have shared a couple of kisses as well as reading the Santo and Colleen letters together.

The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory. I mentioned Goldstein's.

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.

I guess my article about Medium Pimpin is NN so I will give up.

I would like to ask you about the article on Live Prayer however. Yesterday I added a section about a number of prank calls to the show which had been made by TOTSE members. It seems this is quite controversial and there was a lot of vandalism in the article after I added this section.

Now the section has been removed. Why was it removed? There was nothing wrong with it, it cited references.

Is Wikipedia influenced by vandalism? If enough outraged forum users vandalize Wikipedia will we hide the truth? Surely isn't right.

Hello user at address 90.184.243.14,

Hmmm... I don’t really agree with your comments.  I guess the disagreement boils down to what we think that Wikipedia stands for.

I was under the impression that one of the aims of Wikipedia was that it allowed information to be distributed freely worldwide and not to be controlled by commercialist corporations.  You clearly disagree with this perception.  

I take your point that the H-K adsorption isotherm isn't as popular as Langmuir & BET but the equation is peer reviewed and used by a number of research groups.  Taking the info off the adsorption website would consign this peer reviewed equation to books and journals that people would have to pay to access.  

I see this action as being very much against the Wikipedia ethos and think that the text should be reinstated immediately.

Moreover, if possible I think that people should be encouraged to add other “lower status” equations to the webpage so that as much information as possible is disseminated free of charge.

 """"First edition preferred"""" 

Hi.  I was amused to see this added to the infobox on The Small Rain, published in 1945. Having collected L'Engle novels for over 30 years, I've still never even SEEN the original cover of this book - and if I did, I'd have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for Wikipedia. Rest assured that I will always post first edition covers if I have them, but it's not always possible. For example, my hardback of The Young Unicorns is an ex-library rebinding.  I've searched online for the cover of the first edition, and nobody has one posted.  All I see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art. No big deal at this end - I know you're just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible. Still, I'll be very surprised if we ever get 100% compliance on L'Engle books of the 1940s to 1960s. Regards, and keep up the good work!  | Talk | contribs """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Instead, I simply pointed out that Midway's highest ranking authoritytheir CEOhas officially confirmed that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360. Although Epic currently does not acknowledge that they are developing an Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 2007, that definitely does not prevent Midway from Publishing the game for the Xbox 360. 

Midway could easily develop the game for the Xbox 360 on their own, or they could outsource the development to another developer. Let's not forget that the PC is the primary development platform for Unreal Tournament 2007. Midway or an outsourced developer could easily port the game to the Xbox 360 because the Xbox 360 is so easy to program games for, since it is so similar to the PC. However, the Playstation 3 is very difficult to develop games for, and it likely requires skilled developers such as Epic to work on both the PC and PS3 versions at the same time. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Midway CEO David Zucker has made it 100% clear that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360, regardless of who the Developer of the game is.

 Scientific evidences stating Meucci's priority on Bell

1) Anti-sidetone circuit

Meucci began investigating topics related with the telephone """"system"""" in 1858, as shown by a drawing of the same year, reproduced below http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/corradi_drw.gif. 
This drawing formed the basis for Meucci's caveat of 1871, but, as Meucci's lawyer did not file it with the caveat, it was later notarized by Meucci himself in his affidavit of 9 October 1885.The drawing shows a two-way, simultaneous, telephone conversation, with a complete separation between the two directions of transmission (indicated by arrows). This contrivance is aimed to counteract the so-called """"side-tone"""" effect, that is, the hearing of the echo of the speaker's own voice (as well as any background noise) in his own receiver. 
This layout is known today as a """"four-wire circuit"""". With it, Meucci anticipated any other inventor, as proved by the following:

No mention of side-tone effects, nor measures to counteract it, are found in Bell's patents, nor in Gray's caveat, both of 1876. In the first Bell's subscriber lines, the four (initially, two) instruments were simply put in series on the same line.
The first anti-sidetone (AST) circuits were introduced by the Bell people in the 1900s, particularly by George A. Campbell, with his nine patents of 1918, many decades after Meucci's solution was shown in this drawing, and over thirty years after the same drawing was notarized.

2) Inductive loading

The drawing reproduced above http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/lemmi_drw.gif is taken from a note jotted down by Meucci in his Laboratory notebook on 27 September 1870, and reported in an affidavit by M. Lemmi of 28 September 1885, containing the English translation of said notebook (see also my paper on """"Antenna"""").
It can be seen that diagrams """"No. 2"""" and """"No. 3"""" differ from """"No. 1"""" in the insertion midway along the long-distance line of an inductor (with either a horseshoe or bar iron core). In diagram """"No. 4,"""" the inductor is split into two parts, inserted at both ends of the line. In his notes, Meucci pointed out that, in this way, he could get rid of the battery, and that, by splitting the inductor, he obtained better results.
This technique is known today as the """"inductive loading"""" of long distance telephone lines, allowing to increase the distance and/or the quality of speech. The proof that Meucci came first, can be drawn from the following events, occurred many years after Meucci's discovery (or its notarization):

In June-July, 1887, Oliver Heaviside and Alfred Vaschy predicted, on the basis of mathematical calculations, that telephone signals could be transmitted without distortion by increasing the line's self-induction.
On 19 June 1900, M. I. Pupin obtained the first two patents for said technique. The Bell Telephone Co. acquired both patents and, later on, applied them in its lines

3)Means to counteract the skin effect

Because of the increased bandwidth of the telephone with respect to the telegraph, telephone lines were subjected to increased attenuation, due to the so-called skin effect.
In two notes of 1862 in his Laboratory notebook (notarized in Lemmi's affidavit of 1885), Meucci suggested to treat the surface of the (copper) conductor in various ways (basically with graphite) to increase its surface conductivity.
Moreover, in his caveat of 1871, Meucci stated: “I believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph.”
Another note in his notebook, dated 17 August 1870, reads: “To be adopted, for having long distance, bundles of copper wire insulated with cotton or any other kind of wrapper; by this means I have obtained a distance of about one mile.” For this """"bundle"""" of copper wires Meucci filed a US patent application """"Wire for Electrical Purposes"""" on 2 July 1880.

That Meucci was first in said techniques, is proven by the following facts:

Skin effect in telephone lines was neglected by all inventors till 1880, when it began to be investigated by David E. Hughes and Oliver Heaviside.
Following their studies and the development of """"hard drawn"""" copper, the Bell Telephone Co. decided to use copper in place of steel, beginning from the Boston-New York line, which was inaugurated on 27 March 1884.

4) Call signaling

Meucci adopted a telegraphic call signaling, simply effected by a Morse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarily short-circuiting the local transmitter. In this way, strong pulses of current were sent along the line, and the distant receiver would emit intermittent ticks, much louder than the ordinary speech. In his caveat of 1871, Meucci gave a detailed description of his call signaling, consistent w",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll clear this up about my intentions:  I have been told, or glanced over (in passing) several materials purporting the Caribbean slave contribution to the population of Charleston and Savannah (among New Orleans and other multiracially populated areas).  It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some """"noble savages"""" (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South, by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims?  Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!

That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.

See here:
Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!

Since it appears that you have escalated your case to ArbCom, there is really no point in echoing your arguments on your talk page in this way.  You should offer any further information directly and exclusively to ArbCom via e-mail.  If they decide to believe you and reinstate your account, you can share the news here with the rest of us at that time.

Also, previously, I offered you some very concrete suggestions for establishing who you are (as opposed to making claims of who you are not).  If you are not in fact """"Justice Forever"""" and are serious about wanting to convince ArbCom of this fact, I would strongly recommend you follow those suggestions ASAP.  Your latest piece of """"new evidence"""" is really about the same as trying to clear your name via a checkuser request — something which, as you should already understand, is almost never accepted as a way of disproving sockpuppet allegations, and which in fact is more often taken as evidence that you are a sock trying to blow smoke in people's faces.  Unless you present your most convincing information to ArbCom right now, you are likely to find them unwilling to listen to anything further you might have to say, regardless of its merits.

I'm going to stop watching your talk page at this point.  If you are a sock of """"Justice Forever"""", you're wasting my time — and if you are not """"Justice Forever"""", I may be wasting your time by making you feel there is a reason to continue arguing your case here (and in this particular way) rather than talking only to ArbCom and trying to make the kind of case with them that has a chance (though I don't know how much of a chance) of actually working.  Further posting of your arguments here, on your talk page, is very likely to make some admin decide to block you from being able to edit your talk page (and also to semi-protect your talk page to keep you from editing via IP addresses without logging in first).

42a5cbad98e42486,"""

Jack-A-Roe, thank you for responding.  That article says, """"Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation.""""  That raises a question:  In writing the article, I paraphrased the Material (well, some of it).  It seems to me that paraphrasing is necessary when conveying information  I mean, Seth/Roberts published 20 books; and when they discussed a topic, it was discussed in depth.  So my question is:  Is paraphrasing considered to be """"interpretation""""?  To me it is not interpretation, but others might say it is.

It would seem that Verbal thinks I am interpreting instead of paraphrasing.  But since he isn't a knowledgeable editor  meaning an editor with knowledge of the subject matter  I don't see how he can know that.  Verbal, acting on the assumption that I have been interpreting instead of paraphrasing, has been trying to block any new primary sources that I might add.

Now, the article also says that primary sources must be used """"with care"""", but it doesn't say that they can't be used in abundance.  In a case like this, I don't see why the sections that describe the Material can't be abundantly sourced to the Seth books.

I really do have a handicap when it comes to finding secondary sources (what I've been calling """"third-party"""" sources up to now).  I have always been interested in the Seth material, not metaphysics in general.  Thus, I have almost all the Seth books, but few other books on metaphysical subjects where references to Seth/Roberts might occur.  (I do have many Cayce and Casteneda books, but they don't say a thing about Seth.)  Finding more secondary sources is difficult for me because my town has a small library and (you'll be amazed by this) I don't have a car to drive to the nearest city.  However, it seems to me that, given the sale of 8 million books and the secondary references that are already in the article, notability has already been established.

Because I was the only person here who was able to keep reverting Verbal's cuts to the article, I am now being accused of edit-warring.  There's the possibility that I won't be around to prevent Verbal from chop-chop-chopping at the article.  That being the case, I hope you'll stick around.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Cmagha! I never saw the original AfD discussion, but I think the article looks like the start of something fantastic! My only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from """"Cornell specific"""" sources (i.e. Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Era, Cornell Register, etc...). College/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within WP:N when dealing with a campus organization, as some may not consider these to be """"independent of the subject."""" That being said, we aren't dealing with a fly by night college band that played at Moonshadows and had a writeup in the Ithacan, this is a literary society almost as old as Cornell University itself and has had significance well beyond East Hill. Despite the large number of CU oriented sources (which I personally believe are independent), you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another AfD if need be.

 Wow, great work.  Sorry I've been out of the loop.  Double smiley face from the Syracuse Orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality.  Think the critics need to read the article from a distance  this is hardly promotional, when you think about it.  It is basically saying that Cornell University had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity, and tanked.  We obviously would not have done that at SU.  I do think there is a Sumner cite out there to, that Cmagha missed.  Will look for it.

I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called """"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,"""" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax"""", or """"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation."""" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the """"""""Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident"""" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Experimental evidence - reference would be good 

Perhaps a reference should be added to the value of 10 years. The paper given (K. Hagiwara et al., """"Particle Data Group current best estimates of proton lifetime"""", Phys. Rev. D 66, 010001 (2002) ISBN 978-06848657680) dates from 2002 and is presumably from the 2001 Super-Kamiokande results. 

You will be aware that the average non-specialist reader will have seen 10 years, or just 10^33 years, and this is the value that other google sources bring up - from the same Super-Kamiokande experiment. e.g. the hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu site

 images 

are unduely skewed to Mumbai and Delhi. 9 out of 19 images.  Care

Andhra Pradesh  1
Gujarat  1
Rajasthan  1
Tamil Nadu  1
Uttar Pradesh  1
Uttarakhand  1
West Bengal  1

Any suggestions on improving representation? I'll try and replace a couple of the Delhi and MH images. Regards,   

Bengaluru, a bit Mumbai, and maybe a little Ahmedabad. ..  

we have so many cities, towns and villages in india, I wouldt suggest more than one (the most representative) picture for each place.  Care 

I'll be in Mumbai Next week, I can get pics of buses, and trains. I live in Bengaluru, no problem woth pics. I already have a handful that I've been waiting to upload to the commons, but keep forgetting to copy from my phone. I will be going to Ahmedabad, so I might be able to get a few shots there too.... Any idea how to move an existing image to the commons?  

that is awesome. pls take as many pictures as possible. we have been wanting to have a representative picture of road and rail transoprt in Mumbai. A busy road picture and a shot of the interior of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus or any other railway station should be good. Please see Talk:Mumbai#Poll. Moving images to Commons, you might have to individually upload them.  Care 

Update - I have replaced three existing images on the page, and the revised list of image distribution now looks like this:

Delhi  4
